I take off the keyring that was hooked around my finger and put it on the table.

It makes a tinny clinking noise.

I sit down in a chair and sigh.

There's a bottle of water laid out for me.

Very considerate of them.

There's a knock on the door, and it opens before I can answer.

I know the person who's just come in.
???
Why do you even bother knocking?
???
Hahah, sorry 'bout that. It's just been so long! I came running all the way here!

Sumomo smiles merrily.
Sumomo
How long has it been?
???
I forgot, and I'd rather not try to remember. Makes me feel damn old.
Sumomo
Hahah, good point.

Sumomo laughs as she puts down her bag.
Sumomo
All right. Let's get this show on the road.

She moves around behind me and starts playing with my hair.

She feels it out first with her hands, and then a comb.
Sumomo
The first time you had me cut it was in that garage, remember?
???
Right. Never thought we'd make it here back then.
Sumomo
I don't think anyone did, to be fair.

I nod in response.

I close my eyes, and let the comfortable sensation of her hands take over. I think back on that dusty garage.
Sumomo
Now that was a fun summer, huh?

That's right. I forgot it was summer...

The blinding sunlight, the sweltering heat.

The garage with that faded old four-by-four.

The cries of the cicadas so loud they almost hurt your ears.

The comet sweeping through the night sky.

I find my mind traveling back to those days...
Kanna
There we go...

This place used to be an international airport.

Countless pigeons make their nests in the abandoned jumbo jets.

It was only last month when I realized there was such a treasure trove of photography subjects right by my house.

This is how I spend my weekday afternoons.

All my classmates are at the academy taking their lessons.

At first I felt a little guilty about not attending, but I don't anymore.

I hear the wind blow by, the gravel crunch beneath my feet...

And the faint cooing of the pigeons.

Time passes peacefully.

In the distance I see a passenger plane, its paint chipping away.

A behemoth of a vehicle that made its last flight long ago.

I like its melancholy air.

Peering through the lens of my camera, I feel around for a good composition.

When I tilt my camera up slightly, the viewfinder captures the comet with its long tail above.
Kanna
...

I lower the camera.

Not yet.

This is neither the time nor the place to capture it.

I look at my wristwatch.

I should be getting back.

My break is over.
Kanna
This one, maybe?
Kanna
Or... maybe this one...
Kanna
Looks nothing like the manual... What's this? Can I take it off?
Kanna
...
Kanna
Ugh, I don't know!

I kick the ground, and the wheels below me slide me out from under the car.
Kanna
Haah...

I sit up and look through the car's maintenance manual.

The manual is tattered from use, but I still don't understand a lick of it.

The car is a four-by-four left to me by my mom. Its name is Hachimaru.

It's slick like a samurai, and cute to boot.

My mom always called it Hachimaru, and the name stuck with me.

Hachimaru's been silent for a long time now, but I can tell its spirit is alive.

It's July already.

This is the month.

I don't have any time left.
Kanna
Maybe one of the wires is frayed?
Kanna
Better take another look.

I lie back down on the creeper I rigged up with a board and some caster wheels.

My sweaty shirt sticks to my back.
Kanna
It's so hot in here...

I found out “creeper” is the name for those wheeled boards that mechanics use to slide under cars.

It's one of the few things I managed to glean from that worn-out old manual.
Kanna
Dammit. I'm not getting anywhere.

I'm getting impatient. I've really not got time for this.

The sun is setting.

I've gotta take a shower before dad gets home.

If he finds me covered in oil, he'll figure out I was tinkering with the car instead of going to class.

I really don't know the first thing about cars.

But I have until the 28th of this month to somehow get this thing running.

If possible, with my own two hands.

I insert the key into the ignition.
Kanna
...
Kanna
......
Kanna
............
Kanna
Figures.

I get out of the car, wipe my face with a towel, and head to the sink in the corner of the garage.

Another day with no luck.

I see myself in the mirror, covered in oil.

I wipe at the grease with a damp towel.

It's really hard to get it off.

My eyes stray to the cork board next to the mirror.
Kanna
...

It's covered with pictures taken by my mom.

These photos always give me heart.

One is of a comet streaking across the starry sky.

Contemplating the vastness of the universe makes me feel so small... yet at the same time, like maybe my problems aren't so insurmountable after all.

The photo must have inspired those same contradictory feelings in many. It's probably why her work was so popular.

She went wherever she felt like in her car, and took pictures of whatever she wanted.

People called her a "survivalist photographer."

Then, last year, Mom went off on one such trip. Hachimaru came back... but Mom didn’t.

I look at the wall clock through the mirror.

It's already 5 PM.

I prepare to leave the garage with my bag and the clothes I changed out of.

Looking up at the scarlet sky, I see the comet and its long tail drawing a majestic arc through the firmament.

That's Halley's Comet.

It approaches Earth every 76 years.

Excitement has been simmering throughout the world for the last three years, and this year it finally reached boiling point.

The sales of binoculars, telescopes, books, and cameras skyrocketed.

The stores are filled with comet-related merchandise, and impromptu astronomy clubs began to pop up as winter shifted toward spring.

But even before the public at large started gearing up for it, my mom was always thinking of the comet.

Getting to witness an event that takes place only once every 76 years is a miraculous thing for a photographer.

She was always looking for the perfect place to shoot it from. She didn't want to waste the opportunity.

But Mom never lived to see the year 2061.

July 28th...

That's the day when the comet will be closest to the Earth. When its luminosity will reach its peak.

Mom wanted a picture of that beautiful comet.

I'm going to take one for her.

Today's July 8th.

I have twenty days.

Before I go into the house, I check the mailbox.

It contains the evening paper and some leaflets from the neighborhood association.

There's also a letter from the academy.

It's common for them to send one when you're absent without notice for a long time.

I crumple it up and stuff it into my pocket.

I'm about to shove the other letters back into the mailbox when one leaflet in particular catches my eye.
Kanna
Repairs on the go? Marvellous mechanic Azuki?

Former hit MeTuber Azuki will come to your house and repair any vehicle...
Kanna
...

What's a MeTuber?

Never mind that.

Diagnosis is free. Offer applies to old-style and gasoline cars as well.

I stare at the simple handwritten leaflet for a while.

No...

I shake my head.

Mom always kept Hachimaru running herself.

The best people take care of their own tools.

I can't give up yet.

I turn back and gaze once more at the comet hanging in that crimson sky.
Kanna
...

Just in case, I fold up the sketchy leaflet and stow it in my pocket.

I take a shower and change.

Dad's always home by at least 8 PM.

If only he got home later, I could focus more on repairing the car. Then once it was fixed, I could spend that time on my photography instead.

Dad doesn't know I'm trying to fix the car or that I'm really into photography.

I try very hard to make sure he doesn't notice.

I need things to work things out before I tell him.

Photography is a pretty unrealistic profession, so I need proof that I have what it takes.

Real, tangible proof.

Once I have that, I'll tell him.
Dad
Hello there.
Kanna
Hey. How was work?
Dad
Still no haircut? It's way too long.
Kanna
Summer break's next week. I'll get it done then.
Dad
It's too hot for long hair. Get it trimmed.
Kanna
Yeah, yeah.

It's just the two of us sitting at the table.

We're having curry. Again.

We only eat things we can make in advance over the weekend.

We take turns prepping meals on Sundays, then we store the batch in the fridge for the week.
Dad
You decided on a faculty yet?
Kanna
...I still have time.
Dad
You gotta submit your choice during the summer of your second year, right? You still haven't decided?
Kanna
It's fine. It's not like I'm going to a new school.
Dad
The science and humanities faculties charge different fees. You better decide soon.
Dad
Leaving it to the last minute makes it harder on me.
Kanna
...I know.

This is all we ever talk about at dinner.

It wasn't like this when Mom was around.

It was all about the problems that came up during her shoots. About stars, mountains, or car stuff...

Mom was great at telling stories.

I would actively laugh along, while Dad just ate and nodded placidly.

That was our standard family dinner.

But it's different now.

Dad and I just don't seem to know how to hold a conversation.
Dad
Don't get complacent because there's no entry exam. You gotta choose what to do with your life before you get left behind.
Kanna
I know. I'll decide first thing next week.
Dad
Good.

What my dad wants from me is to get through school, get a job, climb the ladder, marry...

He just wants a safe and stable life for me.

If I told him I wanted to be a photographer like mom, he'd probably do a spit-take, like in a cartoon.

If I want to convince him...

I need objective proof, like a license or an award, that I can really make a living at this.

The fact that my mom did it isn't enough.

Even I know that much.

There'll be tons more photo contests than usual this summer.

This summer is the battlefield on which I'll make my future.
