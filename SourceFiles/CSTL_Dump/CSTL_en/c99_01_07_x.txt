The girl has no plate in front of her.

Maybe she ate already.

I wonder to myself as I scoop up some food with my spoon and bring it to my mouth.

It's a slightly sweet porridge-like substance.

It warms me up and makes my stomach clamor for more.

I spoon bite after bite into my mouth.

Then, I raise my face.

I see that the white-haired girl is also eating.
