Asuma
Mm? Kaito?
Kaito
Uh... Ah, huh?
Asuma
Hahah. You stayed over again?
Kaito
...

Still lying on the sofa, I prop myself on an elbow and blink my groggy eyes until reality sets in.
Kaito
Ah... Professor!

The realization hits like a bolt out of the blue and I jump to my feet.
Kaito
I'm so sorry. I just meant to take a nap, and—
Asuma
No worries. I've had stretches of time where my life was like that too. It brings back memories.
Kaito
...I'm sorry.
Asuma
What is it? Were you blessed with another touch of inspiration in your dreams?

He looks at me, his affable demeanor making me feel worse.
Kaito
No, uh...

No matter what I do, Yonagi's face is at the forefront of my mind. All my thoughts end up circling back to that day.

My condition means that the memories don't fade, keeping the emotions I felt at the time as painful as raw as the moment they happened.

Normally, as memories fade, the anger and sadness associated with them erodes as well, giving way for forgiveness and resignation.

But my mind doesn't quite work like that.

All my memories are as vivid as the moment they happened, and the sensations come to me with the same force.

I have no choice but to try and occupy my mind elsewhere, so that it doesn't focus on those memories.

That's how I usually deal with this kind of thing.

However...

My abnormal memory means that I'll just keep accumulating all those negative memories and trying to keep my attention from them, like a trauma.
Kaito
...You don't need waste time listening to my nonsense.
Asuma
Oh, but I do believe you desperately need someone to talk to right now.
Kaito
...
Asuma
May I remind you that I've lived three times as long as you. I know it's easy to forget when I look so comparatively young.
Asuma
I'm married, so I also have some degree of experience in marital matters. We're colleagues, and with any luck we'll continue to be so for a long time. Feel free to talk to me.
Kaito
...Okay.
Asuma
Maybe you should wash your face first, though.

The professor brews coffee while I wash my face, brush my teeth, and straighten my crumpled clothes.
Asuma
How's life in the middle side?
Kaito
It's comfortable, I think.
Asuma
...Now, how is it, really?
Kaito
...

I bite at my lower lip in frustration.
Kaito
The truth is... I'm not sleeping well. Recently, I've lost my appetite too. I only go home to change clothes, pretty much.
Kaito
It's what I always wanted. I finally made it, but...

But what?

I take a moment to think what I'll say next.
Asuma
Actually living there rings a little hollow compared to what you expected?

I nod in agreement.

His smile turns into a light frown.
Asuma
Lethargy, is it? That's no good. Do you experience any discomfort when moving?
Kaito
Huh? Not at all.
Asuma
That's good.

He brings the cup of coffee to his lips and takes a sip.
Asuma
What about your partner?
Kaito
She's still living on the lower side. We haven't spoken for a while.
Asuma
I see.
Asuma
Now I see the cause of your dismay. Your partner must be the kind of person who doesn't have a hard time living in the lower side.
Kaito
It sure seems that way.
Asuma
What kind of person is she?
Kaito
Well...

I feel like this is the first time I've talked about Yonagi with him.

I try to think of a sensible place to start from.
Kaito
There was a time when I was young where I didn't go to school.
Kaito
Back then, she was the one who invited me to come.
Kaito
The day I first met her...
Kaito
That was also the day I met you.
Asuma
Me?

I nod at him.

Squinting, he seems to ponder for a moment, his gaze focused between the two mugs on his desk.
Kaito
That day you taught me about motors. You helped me print the exterior of a toy car a few days later.
Asuma
Was this in the middle square?
Asuma
A motor... Ah, yes, I remember that boy. So that was you?

I nod, feeling a little relieved that he remembers.
Asuma
So that was you! Hahah! You could have told me earlier.
Kaito
I thought it would have been a little audacious of me. You must have seen many thousands of students through the years.
Asuma
So that was the day. I remember it very well. You left a big impression on me back then.

He falls silent again, deep in thought.
Asuma
Yonagi?

I don't believe my ears for a moment.

I had assumed that if he didn't remember me, then he definitely wouldn't remember Yonagi.

He meets around three hundred new students every single year.
Asuma
You were living with Yonagi?
Kaito
...Yes.
Asuma
...

Completely taken aback by the revelation, he looked at me with wide eyes.
Asuma
Hahahah!

To my surprise, he laughs out loud.

I just sit still, watching.
Asuma
I never knew!
Asuma
So your partner was Yonagi this whole time. What a strange coincidence. No, I suppose it's not so surprising when we live in such a small town.
Kaito
Mm?
Asuma
I get it now. I can see how she would enjoy the lowsider life more.
Kaito
...
Kaito
Do you know Yonagi?

He gives me a resolute nod.
Asuma
Do you know much about her family?
Kaito
Nothing at all, actually. That's why we got into an argument when I learned she used to be a midsider.
Asuma
Of the heated variety?
Kaito
I always thought she dreamed of becoming a midsider like me.
Kaito
But we lived all these years together, and I never knew she had actually been there before.
Asuma
This feels like destiny, somehow.
Kaito
Destiny?
Asuma
There's something I need to show you.

A nostalgic smile plays about his face as he goes over his desk, takes a photo frame from it, and comes over to sit in front of me.

He holds the frame out to me.
Kaito
What's this?

He smiles at me and nods encouragingly.

Intrigued, I turn lower my gaze to the photo.
Kaito
That's... you.
Kaito
The picture was taken here?
Asuma
Yes. This was taken over twenty years ago.
Kaito
That's a long time ago.

That said, he doesn't look a day older today than he does in this picture.
Asuma
Does the other person here remind you of anyone?
Kaito
...

There's a man standing next to him.

The first thing that jumps out at me is his white hair and deep red eyes.

This man...
Kaito
Is he Yonagi's...

The professor nods as he sees the realization dawn on me.
Asuma
Her father, yes.
Kaito
Her father...
Asuma
He was a dear colleague of mine. His name was Shiona.
Kaito
Shiona... He was a researcher?

The professor nods again.
Kaito
So that's why Yonagi was a midsider...
Kaito
Because her father was a researcher?
Asuma
Back then, she lived here in the middle side with Shiona and his wife. She was barely more than a baby at the time.

Her father was a researcher like me?

Why would Yonagi keep this from me?
Kaito
...
Asuma
Well, it must be hard for her to speak of the topic. I ask that you try not to resent her for keeping it a secret.
Kaito
What do you mean? Why would it be hard?
Asuma
Her father was an immensely talented researcher. So much so, in fact, that I found myself jealous of his prowess more often than not.
Kaito
...

Professor Asuma has spoken previously of a researcher he once knew. The only person he would call a genius, I recall.

So that was him.
Kaito
So the person you founded the lab with...

He nods again, a glimmer of pride shining in his eyes.
Asuma
That's him. The lion's share of the credit for building the foundation of the virtual space system we work on falls to him. I was mostly just making hardware adjustments.
Asuma
Not to say I was shoddy at my job, but compared with his mastery of the theory and uncanny understanding of the sensory feedback processing, I was working on intern-level tasks.
Asuma
He's the one responsible for the foundation of the software that you are developing further now.
Kaito
...I see.
Asuma
But he was unable to keep working on his research, and he and Yonagi got ranked down to lowsiders.
Kaito
He couldn't? What happened?
Asuma
He started forgetting everything. Eventually, he forgot even himself.
Kaito
Himself?

I've read about the existence of such a brain condition that affected people on the surface from medical books.

But this is the first time I've heard of a case like that down here.
Asuma
As to whether his condition was simply a natural occurrence, or the side effect of using himself as a subject for lab trials time and time again...
Asuma
To this day, no one can tell. But not a day goes by where I don't think of the endless guilt I carry with me.

He says, his gaze apparently miles away.
Kaito
You feel guilty for not noticing it was happening before it was too late?
Asuma
No...

The professor turns to me, his mouth settling into a hard line.
Asuma
I feel guilty for not yet being able to finalize the research he gave his life for.
Kaito
...
Asuma
If I was in his shoes, I'm certain I wouldn't have wanted to be pitied.
Kaito
I see...

The professor fills the silence with a sip of his coffee.
Asuma
And the one person that stood by him to the end was Yonagi.
Asuma
But he... He didn't know who he was, let alone who the small girl by his bedside was.
Asuma
And he left this world like that, not knowing who anyone in his life was.

I look down at my cup of coffee.

Coffee gone cold, hardly appetizing.
Kaito
I had no idea...
Asuma
So Yonagi rejected the idea of living here in the middle side?

I recall her sad expression once more.
Kaito
I don't think she rejected it exactly. But she wasn't happy about it.
Asuma
...
Kaito
She told me she wanted me to wait.
Kaito
She wanted to make sure of something before giving me her answer.

And then, something clicks in my head.

Why would she refuse moving with me to the middle side?

Why would she say it was because she got complacent?

I try to put all the pieces together and formulate a hypothesis.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Most people who live in the middle side are qualified to do so because of the work they perform.

I halt my thoughts and turn back to him.
Asuma
When people lose their jobs, like Yonagi's father, they are ranked down to lowsiders.
Asuma
But back then, her mother stayed in the middle side.
Kaito
She did? How?
Asuma
She remarried with another researcher.

I stared at him, stunned.
Kaito
What? People can just do that?
Asuma
The system allows for divorce and remarriage. Moral implications aside, you can indeed do such a thing.
Asuma
All within the rules, of course.
Asuma
As for what is the right or wrong thing to do, or what a person ought to do and not do with their life, I cannot say.
Asuma
Whatever the case may be, it is clear that remaining a midsider was of the utmost priority for her mother.
Kaito
...

The desolation in her expression back then takes on a whole new meaning now.
Asuma
I'd be lying if I said I couldn't relate to her mother's feelings.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Perhaps that's why she's so determined to appreciate life as a lowsider.
Asuma
Maybe she doesn't want to admit that the way of life her mother so readily abandoned her for is worthless.
Asuma
She always called the forced labor lowsiders do a 'job.' I think she desperately wanted to form an attachment to that life. See the positive side of it, perhaps.

All these years...

Yonagi has always called the forced labor her 'job.'

I have no recollection of her ever using the word 'labor' to refer to it.

Which means that she hasn't ever used the word, at least in front of me.
Kaito
This is all news to me.
Asuma
Forgive me. I did notice you were acting strangely, but I should have said something sooner.
Kaito
It's okay...
Asuma
It'd be better if you heard about it from Yonagi herself.
Asuma
I believe she has very mixed feelings about her family.
Asuma
If there's anyone that could help her, I imagine that'd be you.
Kaito
I'm sorry, I...

The professor nods, directing a knowing smile at me.
Asuma
It's okay. Go to her. I'll send you the location data for the place where she and her father lived.
Kaito
Thank you.
Kaito
*Huff* *Huff*

What Yonagi wanted to make sure of...

I'm almost certain I know what that is now.

I recall the knowledge I learned from those surface books.

Specifically, about a disease once called Alzheimer's.

It's a disease that occurs when a malignant protein called beta-amyloid is produced in high amounts inside the brain, clumping together and collecting between neurons, disrupting and impeding a person's memory.

There were several treatments, but they all served merely to alleviate the suffering of the patient. At the very least, humankind never found a definitive cure for it while on the surface.

Ten percent of the people who develop this condition do so from genetic causes.

Due to being born with an extra chromosome twenty-one.

Which means...

There's a chance that Yonagi inherited the disease from her father.

Regardless of whether or not it occurred in him as a side effect of experimentation, it's possible that he passed it down to her.

That must be what Yonagi's trying to ascertain.

She wants to know if she'll lose herself one day.

She was upset with herself for not having the courage to tell me. She didn't want to hurt me.
Kaito
Why?! What am I here for then?!

I can understand why she wouldn't want to tell me.

But I want her to rely on me.

I want her to believe in me.

I kick up dirt on my mad rush back home.
Kaito
Yonagi!
Izumo
Mm?

I haven't been to my lower side home in several days.

As I swing the door open, I'm not met with Yonagi, but with Izumo staring right into my face by the entrance.
Kaito
Yonagi...
Izumo
Not here.
Kaito
...

I look up at the wall clock.
Kaito
She's still at work?
Izumo
No.

I snap my head back to Izumo.
Izumo
She hasn't been here in the last six days.
Kaito
What?
Izumo
She went to work one day and didn't come back.
Kaito
Why?
Izumo
I don't know. Nothing was said to me.
Kaito
Can't you locate her chip?
Izumo
Only you are registered as my owner. You are the only person I can perform automatic tracking on.
Kaito
Dammit!
Izumo
Shall I search for Yonagi's current location data?
Kaito
Please do.

If she's not here, there's only one other place she could be.
Izumo
Displaying location data.
Kaito
...

She's in the lower side.

And her location is consistent with what the professor sent me.
Kaito
The place where she lived with her father...
Izumo
Are you going?
Kaito
Yes.
Izumo
I'm glad to hear that.
Izumo
Please tell Yonagi that I await her return.
Kaito
Okay, thanks.

The location data leads me to a cluster of small buildings nestled deep into the lower side.

Our house faces the cornfield, and there's actually a view outside the window, so it's well situated, all things considered.

But deeper in the lower side, the middle side blocks out the sunlight, and everything is dark and musty.

The heavy dust is so intense that it's almost hard to keep one's eyes open.

I wade my way through the tight corridors and find the place.
Kaito
This must be it.

I stand in front of the old house and knock on the door.

I rap on it a few times, eliciting no answer.
Kaito
Yonagi? Are you there?
Yonagi
Kaito?
Kaito
I'm coming in.
Yonagi
...Okay.
Kaito
...

The first thing that I notice...

Is the lack of natural light in here.

Full bookshelves cover the walls with countless notes stuck to them.

I notice a familiar hardcover notebook open in the middle of the only desk in the cramped space.

It's the novel Yonagi's writing.
Kaito
You've been writing a novel?
Yonagi
Mhm.

She has a somewhat vacant expression on her face.

It's a far cry from her usual cheery demeanor.
Kaito
Forgive me, Yonagi.
Yonagi
For what?
Kaito
I...
Yonagi
Did the professor tell you about this place?

I nod in response.
Kaito
I also had Izumo look up your location.
Yonagi
I see...

The silence extends excruciatingly.

I turn my eyes to the notebook spread open on the desk.
Kaito
Still writing the story about Shakespeare?

She shakes her head slowly.
Yonagi
There's no point in writing that one anymore.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Now I'm writing the novel I never wanted to write.
Kaito
What?
Yonagi
I'm writing about what I always tried to turn away from. What I've been running away from.

She shows me a tired smile.
Yonagi
You heard about my dad, right?
Kaito
Yeah.

I can't remember a time where her smile looked sadder than this.
Yonagi
I'm sorry for keeping quiet this whole time. I figured I would need to tell you someday.

Her calm tone rings through the room.
Kaito
Izumo told me you haven't been home in a while. You've been here writing this whole time?

She doesn't answer the question.

Instead, her gaze wanders between us.
Yonagi
What is the one thing that you would never want to forget?
Kaito
...

Somehow, I feel like this question means a lot of things.

I don't get the impression that she means any moment or person in particular.
Yonagi
For me, it's my feelings.
Yonagi
The sadness I felt, my anger, and my happiness, of course.

I nod back.

She's said something similar before.
Yonagi
Even if I'm not able to remember every detail of a moment like you can.
Yonagi
The one thing I don't want to forget is what I felt in my heart. That's all.
Yonagi
I believe that's what makes me who I am.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
You remember the first story we made up together, right?

I nod.
Yonagi
When I read Sumomo's story, I remember how I felt when we discovered that clearing with the flowers back when we were kids.
Yonagi
That day we found a beautiful spot where we could see the beautiful sky, hidden so close to the path we walked every day.
Yonagi
It helps me remember how exciting it was to go through that tunnel for the first time, holding hands.
Yonagi
And when I read Olivia's story, I can relate to the confusion of growing so close with the man I love. Too close for him to notice that I wanted more.
Yonagi
You and Will both have such tunnel vision, after all.

She says, a small chuckle leaving her lips.
Yonagi
I guess I also put some of my desires into Olivia. My wish that I could be feminine like her, able to use my charm to make your head turn.
Kaito
Then why did you...

Yonagi stays silent as I speak.
Kaito
Why do all those stories end up with them saying goodbye in the end?

After a moment, she turns to the notebook open on the desk and traces the lines with her fingers.
Yonagi
Because by the time I need these books I wrote...
Yonagi
You won't be there anymore.
Yonagi
You won't be by my side by then.
Kaito
...Why are you so sure about that?

She shakes her head slowly.
Yonagi
I'm not doubting your feelings.
Yonagi
If I died as I am now, I'm sure you'd stay by my side to the end.
Yonagi
But when that time comes, I won't be me anymore.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Do you understand what I'm saying?

After a moment's pause, I nod.

I've been studying the brain and memory for a long time.

I know what happens in cases like these.

I know what's at the end of the road for people with advanced memory loss.

Where does the self lie?

What gives a person their personality?

Their memories, that's it.

A person's individuality lies in their memories.

And when those are lost, whose soul then inhabits that drained vessel?

When all the moments and memories she cherished deep in her heart are gone, will the person who remains really be her?

I don't think I have the answer to that right now.

But I understand what she's saying.
Kaito
But...
Yonagi
Even then, I want to...
Yonagi
When the time comes, I want to be able to look back on the path that got me where I am.
Yonagi
I want to read those stories and remember.
Yonagi
That's my parting gift, from me to her.
Yonagi
That's why...

Her gaze shifts from the notebook to me.
Yonagi
They need to be farewell stories.
Yonagi
I don't want to ignore the huge sadness I feel over how I know it'll end. I want to let myself remember that I was happy, and that's why my sadness was so great.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
When I'm no longer myself...
Yonagi
When I don't know who I am, who you are, where I am, or what year it even is anymore.
Yonagi
When I don't know what I wanted, or who I loved.
Yonagi
I don't want you to see me like that.
Kaito
...You looked into it already?

When she hears that, she stops on the spot.
Kaito
You were trying to find out if your father's condition is hereditary, right?

Yonagi smiles at me and looks into my eyes.
Yonagi
...It was positive. I inherited it.

The answer sinks in like a rock to the bottom of a well.

I find myself unable to speak.
Yonagi
There's no such thing as miracles in this world, huh?
Yonagi
But of course there isn't. We don't live in a novel.

It feels like she's talking to life itself rather than to anyone in particular.
Yonagi
I'm sorry for keeping it from you all this time.
Yonagi
I'm sorry for staying with you without telling you anything.
Kaito
Well... Even if you do have the gene, are you certain you'll experience the symptoms? And if we know it's gonna happen, we can—

Yonagi shakes her head and holds a hand up to stop me.
Yonagi
You don't know what it's like, Kaito. You don't know what it feels like to see a loved one lose themselves in front of your eyes like that.
Yonagi
No matter how smart you are, there's no way you can comprehend it without experiencing it firsthand. And I don't want you to have to go through that.
Kaito
...

Yonagi reaches for a sketchbook sitting on one of the shelves in the center of the room. She slowly opens it up and flips through the pages.
Yonagi
This is what my father kept drawing until he passed away.

Pages upon pages depict the same woman.
Kaito
Who's that?
Yonagi
His ex-wife.
Kaito
...

The person the professor spoke of.

The woman who abandoned her sick husband and her child.

Yonagi's mother.

Her choice of words to refer to the woman doesn't escape me.
Yonagi
He kept drawing her every day, right up until the last moment.
Yonagi
Even after he forgot about his daughter, he kept on drawing her.

She murmurs, her face betraying no expression.
Yonagi
I understand my dad didn't do it out of malice. He didn't even know who he was drawing.
Yonagi
But...
Kaito
...
Yonagi
She just abandoned us like we meant nothing. Do you think I could forgive her for that?
Yonagi
Even when I was the one by his side to the end, he never called my name even once.
Yonagi
But he kept on drawing her till his last day. How could I ever forgive a person like that?
Yonagi
That's what I want to know.

A thin line of tears streaks her cheeks.
Yonagi
I wished I could just forget my past. All of it.
Yonagi
I thought that it would be so much easier if I could forget what that woman did to my dad.
Yonagi
Sometimes I wonder if wishing so hard for it...
Yonagi
...made it come true in the end.

Her voice sounds ghostly, like a shade fading at dawn.

She looks at me with an expression I've never seen before on her face.
Kaito
No, it isn't your fault.
Yonagi
When I came back here a few days ago, I understood your pain for the first time.
Yonagi
Always remembering things you would rather forget must be hard. Every single detail as if it happened moments ago.
Yonagi
Maybe it really is easier to just forget it all.

Never before has Yonagi seemed more frail than in this moment.

Like a statue of crystal, really to collapse at the slightest touch.

Ironically...

That fragility gives her a solemn, enduring beauty. This is one moment that will stay seared in my mind forever, brighter than all else.
Yonagi
But now that I'm aware of my condition, now that I understand it, I want to face my life like I always should have.
Yonagi
I want to use these feelings while I remember them to write a story that will help me recall them later.
Yonagi
That's why I'm finally writing about myself. I finally started writing it.
Yonagi
A story about a lonely girl who could never face her father.
Yonagi
Maybe this story will help reflect those feelings vividly when I start to forget.

I stand there, gazing at her turned profile.
Yonagi
I'm sorry for making you wait for the answer. I'll give it to you now.
Kaito
Yonagi, I...
Yonagi
I can't be together with you. You're the one person in the world who I don't want to see me when I'm no longer myself.
Yonagi
That's why...
Kaito
Yonagi.
Yonagi
Please be happy, Kaito. I know you will.
Kaito
...
Kaito
I...

I stare at her, mouth half open as I search for the words.
Kaito
I became a researcher and got a middle side house like I always wanted.
Kaito
It's spacious, quiet, clean...
Kaito
Everything I ever wanted.

I can see the pain behind her smile.
Yonagi
You worked really hard for it.
Kaito
But...
Kaito
It didn't make me happy. It wasn't fulfilling.
Kaito
The food didn't taste like anything, and I couldn't sleep.
Kaito
Even walking back to that house I always wanted felt painful.
Yonagi
Why?
Kaito
You know why.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Because you weren't there.
Kaito
Neither you nor Izumo.
Kaito
Nothing inside of that fridge was good enough.
Kaito
Nothing tasted better than eating the porridge Izumo makes together in our home.
Kaito
I realized that I was happy there.
Yonagi
Kaito, that's why I...
Kaito
I came here because I finally made up my mind.
Kaito
There is nothing more important to me than our time together. There's no point in living if you're not with me.
Yonagi
But I'll stop being myself someday.
Yonagi
You know I would stay by your side forever if I could. There's nothing I would love more.
Yonagi
I want to break things off now because I know I can't do that.
Yonagi
It's better for us that way.

Yonagi says, before turning her back to me.

I can see her shoulders trembling as she stands there.

I...

How could I be so blind?

Yonagi, she always...

Every day she showed me how precious our life together was for her, her every action and gesture overflowing with pure love.

What was I doing?

What else did I need?

I take a step closer and reach out to her trembling shoulders.

Her scent tickles my nose.

I gently wrap her trembling body in my embrace.
Kaito
Whether or not you're still you...
Kaito
I can decide that for myself.

I notice her eyes narrowing as she lowers her head.
Kaito
That's for me to decide.
Kaito
Even if you forget about me, or yourself, I'll be there for you. I'll be there till the end.
Yonagi
You don't understand anything... You don't get it, Kaito.
Yonagi
When it happens, I won't even remember the time we had together. I won't know who you are, or why you're even there by my side.
Yonagi
And when I don't recognize you, I'm sure you won't recognize me either.
Yonagi
I know what it's like. I saw it happen.
Kaito
I'm telling you.
Kaito
When you're no longer you, I'll stay and tell the person who comes after about us. I'll keep telling her our stories.
Kaito
How we met, how we lived together.
Kaito
And how we came apart...
Kaito
I'll keep telling that person about it.
Kaito
Just like you'll write out your feelings for them, I'll give them my memories.
Kaito
I'll keep on thinking of you. Like I always do.
Kaito
As long as I do that, you'll keep on living in me.
Kaito
You gave me your answer, and this is mine.
Yonagi
You can't just...
Kaito
His name was Shiona, right?
Yonagi
...
Kaito
I never met him, nor even heard his voice, but...
Kaito
He was the one who built up the foundation for the algorithm I installed into Wooleep.
Yonagi
Really?
Kaito
I'm using what he and Professor Asuma made together.
Kaito
When the professor showed me a picture of him, he told me that Shiona's genius made him jealous.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
When you tell someone about a person, an image of that person grows within them.
Kaito
Even if it's just a pale reflection of them, if you keep on doing it...
Kaito
Your dad can live on in the hearts of others.

I catch sight of something in the corner of my eye.

Yonagi is breaking into silent tears in my arms.
Kaito
Tell me about the kind of man your father was to you. What was he like?
Kaito
Even if you were to forget, I never will. Not a single thing.
Kaito
I'll remember every precious memory you have. I'll keep telling you about them until I can no more.
Kaito
I'll stay by your side, forever.
Yonagi
You have more important things to be doing than worrying about me, don't you? Aren't you trying to save people from this life of confinement underground?

I nod.
Kaito
And you're one of those people I want to save, but I...
Kaito
I want to ask for your forgiveness. At some point I forgot what my real goal was.
Kaito
I didn't become a researcher to abandon you. I never wanted to make you sad.
Kaito
I still remember how you looked when you left the house in the middle side.

Her breathing is slow and faint.

Even now, I can feel it.
Kaito
I don't ever want to make you miserable like that again. This time away from you made me realize...
Kaito
The most important thing in my life... The one thing I truly want from the bottom of my heart. I finally know what it is.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
So please, don't cry anymore. I want you to smile.
Kaito
Even more so if we know your time is limited... I want to treasure our time together. Make it the best time of our lives.
Yonagi
But I can't let you bear all those memories alone after I'm gone. I don't want you to be alone...
Kaito
I don't care if it'll be over one day.
Kaito
I don't care if you forget about it someday.
Kaito
I still want to spend the time we have together.
Kaito
So, please...
Kaito
Let's live together again.
Yonagi
...
Yonagi
I won't have children. I don't want to make anyone else suffer like me. I won't be able to leave anything to you. I would just... steal your time away.
Yonagi
You still want to be with me? You want to marry a woman who can't give you anything?
Kaito
All you need to leave me with is the memories we make together. That's enough for me.
Kaito
My good memory will come in handy for once.
Yonagi
...That's not true. You're just trying to be kind.
Kaito
I've got to make up for being an oblivious idiot for so long somehow.
Yonagi
*Sniff* Oh, you dummy.

A faint smile breaks across her face.
Kaito
Let's go home. Izumo's waiting for us.
Kaito
She must be lonely.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
She wanted me to tell you that she's been waiting for you.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Kaito
Let me read your new book.
Kaito
Tell me everything about you.

I feel her take a deep breath.

The tears continue running down her cheeks in a silent stream.

Today, for the first time...

I came to know how delicate Yonagi really is.
Yonagi
Are you sure about this? You won't regret it later?
Kaito
No. Not ever. I swear.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Let's get married. Let's be together, as husband and wife.

Yonagi gives me a small nod.
Yonagi
...Yes.

Yonagi puts a hand over her mouth, unable to contain the tears flooding down her face.

I've come to know a new side of her today.

And I've realized something else too.

It's my responsibility and my desire to commit all of her to mind, and remember for the both of us.
Yonagi
Thank you, Kaito.

We walk through the lower side streets, holding hands.

This place is definitely a tough sell.

The air is stagnant, it's humid and dark. You can't get away from the stench of fertilizer.

But...

All I can focus on is the warmth of Yonagi's hand in mine.

That makes everything else seem secondary.

I suppose my hypothalamus must be slacking off and not processing all the sensory information it should be receiving.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
Yes?
Yonagi
Do you want to live in the middle side?
Kaito
...I wonder about that.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
The experience so far has left me ambivalent to it, I suppose.
Kaito
I'm not sure if that's good or bad, though.
Yonagi
I see.
Kaito
It is convenient to live near the institute, but I've realized I don't actually mind walking through the cornfields.
Kaito
I'm fine living wherever you want to be.
Yonagi
I...
Yonagi
We have so many memories with Mom in that house; that's why I like it. But I don't want to get in the way of your work.
Yonagi
If it'll help your research, I don't mind moving to the middle side.
Yonagi
It made your commute easier, didn't it?
Kaito
There's no hurry to make a decision. I'll tell the professor I'll be staying in the lower side again for a while.
Yonagi
Won't you lose the house up there?
Kaito
I'll ask about it. But he told me a lot of midsiders have houses in the lower side as well.
Kaito
I don't think it really matters where I live.
Kaito
Though I suppose there aren't a lot of midsiders who would rather live in the lower side.
Yonagi
I see.

We stay silent for a while as we slowly make our way through the cornfield on our way home.
Yonagi
I wonder if it's okay...
Kaito
What do you mean?
Yonagi
To feel this happy.

She says, looking a bit bashful.

We continue walking together for a while before I figure my answer.
Kaito
I think you're asking the wrong question.

I turn back to look at her and continue.
Kaito
Why shouldn't we be happy? We need to be happy.
Kaito
It's our duty to make the moments we spend together happy and worthwhile.
Kaito
We have to make more happy stories so I can tell them back to you later.
Kaito
Isn't that right?
Yonagi
Mhm.
Kaito
Let's treasure our time together. Even if we fight—and I know we will sometimes—let's talk things over and not dwell on them.
Kaito
We don't have time to be falling out, I should think.
Yonagi
Yeah. We've got to be open about our feelings.
Kaito
Yeah.

We lapse into silence after that.

But it's not an uncomfortable silence.

It's full of the certainty that our connection goes beyond words.

The realization that there's nothing else to say, at least for now.

It's a fulfilling sensation, for sure.
Yonagi
Kaito?
Kaito
Yes?
Yonagi
...We're going to bed together tonight, okay?
Kaito
...

My head snaps back to her.

I'm met with her big eyes upturned to me, and a rosy blush gracing her cheeks.

Perhaps we do need to talk about one more thing tonight.
Yonagi
You know what I'm trying to say, right?

I nod in response.
Yonagi
You're the one who said we needed to be open, right?
Kaito
Yeah, of course.
Yonagi
I know you won't get the hint unless I hit you over the head with it.
Yonagi
I was thinking the mood was gonna take us there anyway, but I had to make sure.
Kaito
...

Thank goodness she did.
Yonagi
God knows how long you'd keep me waiting if today didn't persuade you to make a move.
Kaito
You've been waiting?
Yonagi
Of course, you big dummy.
Kaito
I see... Oh man...
Yonagi
No cold feet now, okay? You want to know everything about me, right?
Kaito
Right.

We keep walking through the chilly fields.

But then something hits me.

Izumo's back home.

How can we do anything with her there?

Is it okay if we just... do it in front of her?

I mean, it's not like she's actually a person.

But I can't imagine having someone stare as we make love is very conducive to a romantic mood.

That's not how it works, right?

What do I do now?

Maybe ask Izumo to go out on an errand?

It'll be the first time I ask her do something like that.

Will she be okay? I don't want her getting lost...
Yonagi
Ahahahah!
Kaito
What is it?
Yonagi
Your hand's super sweaty! Are you nervous?
Kaito
How could I not be? It's my first time.
Yonagi
Don't worry, it'll be mine too.
Kaito
There's something else worrying me, though.
Yonagi
Really?
Kaito
What should we tell Izumo?
Yonagi
Ah, I see what you mean.
Kaito
Um, maybe we should ask her to go outside while we, uh...
Yonagi
Well, duh! It'd be like something from a horror novel if Izumo was stood there staring at us while we did it for the first time!
Kaito
Yeah, right.
Yonagi
I doubt she would mind if we did anything in front of her, though.
Kaito
I know what you mean.
Kaito
What should we do when we get home?
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
You know, the whole thing they do in Japanese novels? Dinner, bath, or—
Yonagi
Now I have to play the wife?
Kaito
Uhh?
Yonagi
Okay, let's go with dinner! I'm sure Izumo will want us to have dinner no matter what.
Yonagi
It's been a while, and we need to apologize to her. We've kind of left her in the dark with this whole thing between us.
Kaito
...Right.
Kaito
I've missed her porridge.
Yonagi
We're back!
Kaito
Hello there.
Izumo
Welcome back.

Izumo and Wooleep come to greet us like nothing happened.

Coming home together like this reminds me of the days when we still worked together in the lower side. It's kind of nostalgic.
Yonagi
I'm sorry for leaving you alone for so long, Izumo.
Izumo
Mm?
Kaito
You can start making meals for two from now on.
Izumo
Understood. Will you be dining now?

Yonagi and I exchange glances.

I notice her happy smile and feel my chest swell with relief.
Yonagi
Yeah, we're starving!
Izumo
I'll prepare dinner at once.

Dinner is, of course, porridge.

When we finish eating, Izumo clears away the plates and starts washing them.

My eyes meet Yonagi's.

That's enough to make my face grow hot.

She looks at me and smiles fondly.

Looking at those soft cheeks, I can't help but wonder how soft the rest of her may be.
Kaito
Uh, Izumo?
Izumo
Yes?
Kaito
Can I, uh, ask you to take care of an errand?
Kaito
Can you do it?
Izumo
An errand.
Kaito
I, erm, so it's about the house in the middle side. There's some stuff in there I want you to fetch.
Izumo
Understood. What is it?
Kaito
Like my books, and my mobile terminal.
Izumo
Understood. The middle side, correct? Please send the destination data and the list of objects to retrieve.
Kaito
O-Okay...
Izumo
I shall go now.

Izumo goes out the door with Wooleep in tow.
Yonagi
...I feel like we're being kinda mean.

Yonagi has a slightly troubled smile on her face as she watches the door close behind Izumo.
Kaito
Yeah, I guess...
Kaito
Still, I feel like Izumo feels a lot better when the three of us and Wooleep are together.
Kaito
Though I could just be imagining things.
Yonagi
No, I think the same. She looked really lonely when you weren't around.
Kaito
Really?
Yonagi
Mhm.

I straighten my posture on the chair and look at her again.

Admittedly, I feel nervous simply thinking about what's about to happen.

I try to keep my cool, hoping she doesn't notice.
Yonagi
Could you turn off the lights?
Kaito
Uh, sure...

I get up hurriedly and flip the light switch.

When I turn back, I find Yonagi standing in front of me.

She comes over to me slowly, directing a meaningful smile my way. Somehow, she reminds of Olivia right now.
Yonagi
Kaito...

I'm too stunned to do anything but nod.

Her face gets closer and closer.

She cups my cheek with one hand.
Yonagi
I'm so happy.
Yonagi
And it's all thanks to you.
Kaito
I'm happy too.
Yonagi
I want you to know everything there is to know about me.
Yonagi
And I want to know more about you too.

I nod again.
Yonagi
We've lived together for so long already, but it sure took us a while to get here, huh?
Kaito
Sorry about that...
Yonagi
I've been waiting for this for so long. You had no idea, did you?
Kaito
...No.
Yonagi
I'm done waiting now.
Yonagi
Are you ready?
Kaito
...

When I nod once more, Yonagi cups my other cheek gently.

She brings her face closer... and our lips meet.

I can feel the warm touch of her soft lips on mine.

I carefully wrap an arm around her waist and pull her closer.

She accepts the gesture, entrusting herself to me.

There's no more distance between us.

Her scent surrounds me.

Each sensation my senses experience comes together into an orchestra of pure bliss.

I feel her faint breath brushing against my face.

Our lips stay locked for longer than I care to count.
Yonagi
Kaito...

I see the pure passion burning in her eyes.

It's like fire, seeping into me and burning me from inside.
Kaito
Yonagi...
Yonagi
We're not stopping here, are we?

I shake my head in response.
Kaito
I don't know if I'll be any good at this, though...
Yonagi
I'm doing it with you, and that's all that matters.
Yonagi
It doesn't matter if you need to learn your way at first.

Yonagi brings her lips in close to my ear.
Yonagi
I want you to make love to me.

She whispers, planting a kiss on my ear before pulling back.

Then she looks up at me through her lashes, a seductive smile playing across her lips.

It is the first time I've seen such an expression on her face.

A pale light seeps in through the window.

The only things visible outside are the tall stalks of the cornfields.

The moon is hidden from sight, though its pale glow remains.

Yonagi rests her head on my chest, her shoulders rising and falling as she breathes.

We're sharing the bed, her bare skin in contact with mine.

Never before have I connected so deeply with someone.

I bask in the happiness of the moment as I stroke her silky white hair.
Yonagi
Do you think Mom knew we were gonna end up like this someday?

I turn my gaze down at her.
Yonagi
Become a couple like this?
Kaito
I wonder about that.

I murmur as I keep stroking her hair.
Yonagi
I bet she knew.
Kaito
Probably.
Yonagi
I'm sorry I can't have your baby.
Kaito
It's okay.
Yonagi
But you wanted children, didn't you?
Kaito
I realized something while living up there. Happiness isn't all about the ideal I have in my head.
Kaito
Someday, when you forget it all...
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Being able to tell the Yonagi who's left behind about us will be one form of happiness for me.
Yonagi
Thank you, Kaito. Thank you so much.
Yonagi
And sorry... I'm so sorry...

She buries her face in my chest.

I can feel her warm tears on my skin.

I keep on stroking her hair.

There's no point trying to sugarcoat things.

We've decided not to run away from reality anymore.

Someday she'll forget.

And we need to accept that.

Her soft sobbing...

The warmth of her tears, and the softness of her skin on mine...

Committing all of it to memory and engraving it deep into my soul...

That is my duty from today onward.
