We cuddle up together in the bed as we soak in the afterglow of our lovemaking.

The sunlight seeping through the window plays across Yonagi's fair skin.

We're surrounded by the gentle breeze and the sound of waves.
Kaito
So everyone must have been thinking of you.
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
That's why we can touch each other again.

I look down at our interlocked hands.
Yonagi
Everyone's so kind. This is such a kind world.
Kaito
Yeah, you're right.
Kaito
I'm sure there are many people who'll want to catch a glimpse of you from now on.
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
You're a goddess, remember?
Yonagi
Right. It's just a little... No, actually, it sounds like it could be fun.

She says as she rests her head on my chest.
Kaito
The stories you wrote...
Yonagi
Mhm?
Kaito
They were all stories that ended in separation.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Yonagi
Yeah, because back when I was writing them, I wanted to prepare myself for us to say goodbye.
Yonagi
I just couldn't write any other conclusions to them.
Kaito
But now...
Kaito
Your own story didn't end in separation.
Yonagi
Yeah, that's right.
 
I'd like for those three to be happy too.

She raises her head and looks up at me.
Kaito
And I'd like to tell everyone about it, starting tomorrow.
Kaito
Don't you think it'd be nice to give them happy epilogues?

Her smile widens as I finish speaking.
Yonagi
You're right.
Yonagi
Okay, I'll make them now.
Yonagi
Which one do you wanna hear first?
