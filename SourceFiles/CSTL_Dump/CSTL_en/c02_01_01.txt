??
There's a castle in Denmark haunted by a ghost. But not just any ghost! It's the ghost of the king himself!
??
The spirit stands at his son's bedside every night!
??
In time, it drove the poor lad mad...
??
They say he let his uncle take the throne in his place. The throne that his father left him, that was rightfully his!
Regular Patron 1
At least, that's the rumor I heard while I was in Denmark. What say you, Will? Intriguing, eh?!
Will
That story again? Haven't you heard any better ones?
Regular Patron 2
And isn't the prince a bit spineless to be the son of a man who sticks around after death?
Regular Patron 1
Nah, that's how families turn out sometimes. Like when you get a worthless drunkard father to a truly upstanding lad...
Regular Patron 1
Why, just like you two here.
Father
Who're you calling a drunkard, eh?!

My dad, who's sitting at the end of counter, snaps back.
Father
*Cough*! *Cough*!

It leads him to a coughing fit.
Regular Patron 1
Whoa there, old man. Don't die on us.
Father
I got something in me throat, Will. Give me some ale, would ya?
Will
Yeah, right! Have some water!
Father
The water's awful in this damn rat hole! Ain't that right, Ed?
Will
This is YOUR damn rat hole!
Ed
Heh.
Rob
Like stupid father, like stupid son.
Father
You what?! Hey, Will! Give 'im a good smack right on the noggin! For the both of us! Come on!
Will
Dad, they're patrons.

I notice Ed's cup is empty, so I pour him some more ale.

He flashes me a grin.
Ed
Hmm. It's true that Rob's story just now is lacking something.
Will
How about the one you told about the power struggle over in the Netherlands? The two would go together well.
Rob
Netherlands?
Ed
Hm?

Both Rob and Ed cock their heads in confusion.
Will
You know, how the queen had an affair with the king's younger brother, and then they conspired to assassinate him.
Rob
I don't remember a story like that...
Will
Well, you told it! You forgot?!
Father
Right in the noggin! While he's distracted!
Will
We moved on, Dad. Pipe down already.
Father
...

My father dejectedly hangs his head.

Rob laughs uproariously.
Ed
If only it were true, but Rob's stories are always just some bunk he heard around town.
Rob
When did I tell this story again?

Rob leans over to me.
Will
About two years ago? You told it on a rainy day.
Rob
How am I supposed to remember something I said over drinks two years ago?!
Father
Say it like it is, Rob! Grab that no good son of mine and smack him on the noggin!
Rob
Is that what you did back when your eyes were good, Boss?
Will
You bet! He whacked me so hard my memory's messed up. Now I remember everything I ever heard.
Ed
Jokes aside, I think that's a great ability. You should put it to use in other areas, not just remembering Rob's silly stories.
Rob
Yeah, you could memorize some recipes for food that's not crap.
Will
Ah, put a lid on it, would you?
Ed
So, how do you link this Netherlands story with the Danish ghost story?
Will
Well, what if the king learned of his wife's betrayal just before he died?
Father
What a rotten way to die! Unforgivable!
Will
But her younger brother and the queen still manage to take the throne.
Father
Shameless! And you call yourself my son?! I didn't raise you like this!
Rob
Boss, we're not talking about Will here. Keep it quiet, would ya?
Father
...
Will
The young prince suspects nothing, until one day, his father's ghost appears to him.
Will
The ghost entreats the boy to take revenge on his own mother... and that's how you line them up.
Ed
It does sound quite interesting.
Father
So what does the prince do after that?!
Will
Dunno.
Father
Why not?!
Will
I just came up with it now.
Ed
Revenge against his mother who conspired to kill his father and put her lover on the throne. This story sounds violent indeed.
Rob
Heh, nothing that we don't see all the time in this rotten world. Nothing unheard of to you especially, eh, Ed?
Ed
...Yes, quite.
Will
Oh, right. You work at a theater, don't you?
Ed
Yes. The popular plays are always filled with bloodshed and violence.
Rob
Gotta wonder if it's the writers or the public asking for that kind of story.
Ed
A mix of both, I'd say. But it keeps the seats full, and the scones sell quite well.
Rob
That's Tenbridge's most popular theater for you.
Ed
But I'm certain you can write something good, Will. Why, I wouldn't put it past you to beat some of the scripts we get at the Lily Theater.
Rob
Aye! And I'll do my part by bringing you more great stories!
Will
Why don't you focus on your real job instead?
Rob
It's the last time I sell to you, ya bastard! Especially since you turn right around and sell them as-is!
Will
I'm particular about dish presentation, I'll have you know.
Rob
You just throw slices on a plate! Now I'm never selling to you again, and that's that!
Ed
Without the pickled herring, all we'll have to go with the drinks will be potatoes.
Will
We have soup too.
Rob
No one wants soup with their booze! It all just sloshes around in your gut! Why is soup the only warm thing on this damn menu?!
Will
Because that's all I can make.
Rob
How many years have you been doing this?! It's your damn pub, do something about it!
Will
It's my dad's, actually.
Father
Though I'm not much more than part of the furniture by now.
Rob
You could afford to be as quiet as the rest of the tables then, boss.
Will
Agreed.
Father
Give me a drink if you want me to shut up!
Will
Is that a threat?
Rob
What's worse, there's no pretty ladies to look at. Ain't that right? What's even keeping us here?
Ed
Well, Will is quite the looker. I always enjoy having him around.
Rob
Say, my lad. Have you ever thought about crossdressing? You have a pretty cute face.
Ed
Your voice is high enough too.
Father
Yeah, why were you born a boy? I would've preferred a daughter, I would.
Will
I see the drinks are kicking in, eh?
Rob
It's settled, then! I'll get a costume from the Spencer troupe next time I visit! It'll fit you, I'm sure!
Rob
They get no customers, so I bet they'll be glad to give you a pretty dress!
Will
No way! We could hire a real girl if you lot would contribute more! Come on, drink! Eat! Stuff your faces, you swine!
Rob
Oi, boss! Your boy's callin' his customers swine. Don't you think he needs a whipping?
Father
Give him a whack on the noggin for me.
Will
Bunch of violent pigs, the lot of you!
Ed
I'd say this sense of camaraderie is something you can only get from a good bartender.
Rob
Want me to pay up that bad? Well, let's see how you like this! Fetch the cups, lad! The first one to fall off his chair loses!
Will
Bring it on!
Father
Ey! Let me in on the fun too!

The pub is full of familiar faces tonight.

How many years has it been since I started manning the counter myself?

Thanks to the friendly regulars, I managed to get used to serving people, despite my initial lack of aptitude.

We don't get that many customers, so I manage on my own.

That's the reason our menu is so limited.

But the complaining from the regulars is part of the fun.

Another day's work over.

My dad is at his usual seat at the end of the counter, slumped face down over the bar.
Rob
Oi, Will.

Just as I'm about to lock up for the night, I'm approached by Rob, one of the regulars who has stuck around until the wee hours.

Whenever he stays until closing time, I know exactly what he's after.
Will
What is it? We're closed, all right?
Rob
No, no more drinks for me. I want you to work your magic again.
Will
Again? You're that short of hands? Surely you have your pick here in Tenbridge.
Rob
I could fill the Queen's castle with people who want to write. But I can count the number of writers who can please an audience with one hand.
Will
Hah, that so.
Rob
It can be comedy, tragedy, whatever you like.
Will
I don't mind writing something, but it's gonna eat into my prep time tomorrow. You okay with soup and potatoes to complement your ale tomorrow?
Rob
Don't you worry. Your food sucks whether you prepare it in advance or not.
Will
Oh, stuff it!
Rob
The point is, focus on what you're good at.
Will
If only I were good at it!
Rob
Well, you're better at writing than cooking, at least.
Rob
I'll increase the pay from last time, okay? Sound good?
Will
...

I look back at the counter.

My dad's dozing off.
Will
Give me an advance and I'll start tonight.
Rob
That's more like it! By the way, I'm told they want to start rehearsing this weekend.
Will
That only gives me two days!
Rob
Hahahah!
Will
This isn't funny! That's even less time than the last time!
Rob
Aw, come on. How about you use that story from today? The one about the Danish ghost.
Rob
Yeah, make something out of that idea. I wanna see how it turns out.
Will
I can't write a full tragedy in two days.
Rob
How about a comedy, then?
Will
How am I supposed to write a comedy out of a man killing his mother after she killed his father?
Rob
My lad, I am a firm believer that limits are made to be overcome.
Will
What about the physical limits?! I can't just close up shop!
Rob
You can do it! I believe in you! Forgo sleep for a couple days, and you'll be golden!
Will
You say that after making me stay up all night drinking with you?!
Rob
Here's your advance! That's half the money! See you later, lad!
Will
Ah! Hey! You lousy—!
Will
Two days, huh?

I scratch the back of my head with one hand while I open the other.

The coins make a satisfying clink as they settle.

I stare at the three coins for a moment before putting them on the table.
Will
Guess I gotta write then, huh.

I turn to my collapsed father and pat him on the back.
Will
We're done for today, Dad. You can go sleep upstairs.
Father
Nh? Ah, my boy. Sorry, I dozed off.

I hand him his cane, take his hand to help him up, and we head to the stairs.
Will
Rob stayed till late tonight. I'll handle the prep for tomorrow.
Father
He asked you to write another play?
Will
Yeah.
Father
Guess you inherited that talent from me. Sorry about that.
Will
I don't think I've seen you write a word in my life.
Father
But I always thought I might write some day. Why, I do even now.
Will
You won't, don't worry.
Father
Tsk! Look at you, getting a big head just because you can string some words together!
Will
It's an honor to be able to write a script for a Tenbridge Troupe. I'm doing it because I like writing. I'll make sure it doesn't hurt the pub.
Father
Nah, it's your pub now. Do whatever you like with it.
Will
You're the owner.
Father
I'm just a blind old drunkard now.

There's nowhere in this place that I need to guide my father to.

He knows this pub like the back of his hand.

So long as I put the seats back where they belong after the patrons are gone, my dad can find his way around with his cane no problem.

It took him a while to get used to losing his sight, but never underestimate how adaptable we humans can be.
Father
I'll hit the hay, son.
Will
Sleep well.
Father
Good night. Don't stay up too late.

He slowly climbs the stairs.
Will
...

I spread today's profits on the counter.

Another month in the red...

Even with the advance I got from Rob just now, it's not enough.

All this money will go right back into opening the shop tomorrow.

I sigh and brush my bangs off my forehead.

I'm seriously considering crossdressing if it'll bring more customers.

I can't even give my father a proper meal with this.

I let out another huge sigh in the empty pub.

No, this is no time to feel sorry for myself.

We can't live unless I earn money.

I get up and use the leftovers behind the counter to dish out supper for myself and breakfast for Dad while thinking about the script in my head.

There's just no time.

Do I use something I already wrote? Or slap something together out of half-formed ideas?

It'll have to be one or the other.

I think back on the stories I've heard during my time here.

All kinds of people from different backgrounds visit our pub.

This small room is like a vast library.

I think back on tales I've heard.

Shocking stories. Pathetic stories. Heart-wrenching stories.

All kinds of stories.

I put my father's breakfast in a pot for tomorrow and grab my own bowl of supper.

Then I blow out the lamps and head upstairs.
Will
The King of Denmark, huh?

I sit at my desk and stare intently at the quill.

My mind keeps coming back to that story Rob told today.

Ghosts, assassinations, parricide...
Will
No way I can pull all those threads together in time.

I do think it would make a good story.

But I just can't put it together in two days.

I take a parchment from the shelf and look through some of my unfinished writing.

I can't be too picky now.

I have no money, therefore I must write.
Will
Rehearsal in two days, huh?

Yet I have no time either.

First, I need to decide what to write.

Rereading some of my unfinished scripts, I remember the settings in which I heard each of the stories.

Wars between England and France, infighting between three princesses, a political play about ancient Rome...

Tenbridge is a hub for merchants who travel all around the continent.

Truly, I feel blessed to be in a place where so many stories converge.

One of them catches my eye in particular.
Will
Oh, I'd forgotten about this one.

I search through my memory.
Will
I got this one from Rob. He's really all about those rumors, eh?

Two women and two men.

A tale of foolish youths in love.

He said that he heard it in Italy, if I remember correctly.
Will
This could work, actually.

The concept is attention-grabbing and the story is clear-cut.

It'll be simple to write the kind of comedic scenes people would expect from reading the summary.
Will
All right. Let's go with this.

I turn back to my desk and pick up the quill.
