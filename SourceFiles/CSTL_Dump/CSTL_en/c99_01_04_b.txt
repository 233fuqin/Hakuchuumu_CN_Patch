Yonagi
...
Kaito
...

Did someone call my name?

No, must have been my imagination.

I stare at the ceiling again then close my eyes.

When I do, I see an afterimage of Yonagi's peaceful sleeping visage.

The sound of her breathing reaches my ears together with the soft buzz of the air conditioner.

For some reason, I find it strangely comforting.

And soon, my consciousness starts to slip.

Again, to that dream...
