Yonagi
*Cough*

I look back to find Yonagi coughing with a frown on her face.

Maybe she's not used to the air out here.

Wanna go back?
Yonagi
...

She bobs her head.

*Sigh*

After coming back from the rooftop, I'm shown the bathroom and the recreation area.

The recreation room is well stocked with children's toys and board games.

No much recreation for me, I suppose.

Yonagi follows me the whole time. When we get back to our room, she goes straight to her bed and sits down.
Yonagi
...

There is only silence between us.

There are two beds in the room and a single basin.

Above the basin, a simple mirror is fixed to the wall.
