Once we arrive at the recreation room, Yonagi goes and takes two dolls from the toybox.
Yonagi
Here.
Kaito
Hm?

She presents me with a doll that looks like a prince.
Yonagi
You're the boy.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
I will be the princess.

She says, holding a doll in a pink dress in her hand.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
Prince, are you coming to see me?
Kaito
Oh, I'm the prince?
Yonagi
Yes, you are the boy.
Kaito
Okay, gotcha.
Yonagi
And the prince rides this. Here.

Yonagi presents me a brown, four-legged doll.
Kaito
All right.
Yonagi
Uh...
Kaito
Huh?

Yonagi groans, and the doll falls to the floor.
Yonagi
The princess died.
Kaito
What?!
Yonagi
She'll revive when the prince comes back.
Kaito
Ah, then he better hurry.
Kaito
Clop... Clop... Clop...
Yonagi
You're riding a horse. It should be faster.
Kaito
Oh, right.
Yonagi
Faster. Clop clop clop.
Kaito
Clop clop clop!
Yonagi
And now that he's here, the prince cries.
Kaito
Because his princess died?

Yonagi nods.
Kaito
O-Oh, princess... Boo hoo...
Yonagi
He would cry harder.
Kaito
W-Waaah, waaah.
Yonagi
And then the prince dies.
Kaito
Him too?!
Yonagi
Hurry.
Kaito
O-Oh, cruel world... Thud...

I let the doll fall to the floor.
Yonagi
Upsy-daisy.
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
The princess came back to life.
Kaito
Why?!
Yonagi
She wasn't dead.
Kaito
What about the prince?!
Yonagi
He's dead, right?
Kaito
No way!
Yonagi
Uhhh... Thud.
Kaito
What happened to her now?!
Yonagi
She was so sad about the prince dying that she died of sadness.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
And they lived happily ever after.
Kaito
What?! No?!
Yonagi
It's fine!

Yonagi snaps back.
Kaito
O-Okay. It's fine.

That was a weird story.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Huh? Yonagi?

After repeating the same story with the doll three times, she begins rubbing at her eyes.
