Mom
And at the end of the long, long tunnel...
Mom
Kaito saw the sea and the sky stretching as far as the eye can see. Seeing the beauty of nature extending out towards the horizon took his breath away. It was everything Kaito imagined and much, much more.
Mom
Countless creatures swam through the clear waters.
Mom
The clouds rolled lazily across the sky, and white birds rode the winds with abandon.
Mom
When Kaito took a deep breath, his chest was filled with the clean sea breeze.
Mom
It smelled just like the wind he had dreamed of so many times before.
Mom
And for a moment, Kaito forgot all of the pain and suffering he had endured on his adventure. Finally, he had made it to his destination.
Mom
The end.
Kaito
Mommy, the sea and the sky are big and blue, right? And they go on forever, right?
Mom
Yes, they're so wide you can't see the end of them.
Kaito
But then how do we know where the sky ends and the sea starts?
Mom
Hmm, that's a good question. I've never seen them either!
Kaito
The sky is air, and the sea is water, right?
Mom
Yes, sweetie.
Kaito
Do you think they're still above ground?
Mom
Yes, I think so. The Earth used to be called the water planet.
Kaito
Ooh, the water planet?
Kaito
Then if I make something so people can go outside, I can go and see them?
Mom
Yes, I'm sure you can!

Mom closes the book.

"Kaito's Adventure".

That's the title of the book.

It's a picture book about a boy named Kaito who travels in search of the sea and the sky.

Mommy loves it, and I love it too.

One day, Mommy told me that she got my name from this book.
Kaito
You want to see the sky and the sea too, right?

Mom smiles and nods.
Kaito
I'll show them to you! I'll be an inventor when I grow up!
Mom
Wow!
Kaito
I'm making a car right now.
Mom
A car?
Kaito
Yeah! It's a machine people used to move around on the surface a long time ago.
Mom
People can ride on it?
Kaito
Yeah!
Kaito
I'm making a small car. But the way it works is the same, so if I make a big one, people can ride on it!
Mom
That's amazing, sweetie! Mommy can't wait to see it!
Kaito
I'll show you when it works! It's not done yet.
Mom
Hehe.
Kaito
I'll go warm up the food.
Mom
Thanks, sweetie.

Our house was made by digging a big hole in the dirt and sticking sheet metal on the walls. That's why it's a little cramped.

There's only a bed, a dining table, the kitchen, and a washbasin.

Outside the window, all you can see is the cornfields, and past that, the earth wall on the opposite side.

All around us are more people living in their small clay houses like us.

I get some corn flour from the cupboard and mix it with water.

I knead it, make it round, and smash it flat.

Then I oil up the flat pan and arrange the dough on top of it.

I flip the electric switch to turn on the heater and start the tortilla frying, and then heat up the corn stew we got as rations.

Once they're ready, I serve the tortilla on a flat plate and the stew in a bowl.
Kaito
Okay.
Kaito
It's ready.
Mom
Thank you.

Mom rests the tray on her lap and brings a spoonful of stew to her mouth.
Kaito
Will you read me another book when you're done eating?

She smiles and nods in response.
Kaito
Okay, I'll see you later.

I pick up my bag and sling it over my shoulder.

Mom made the bag for me when she was still well.
Mom
Be careful out there.
Kaito
I'll be back before it gets dark.
Mom
Okay.

I close the door, go up the dirt stairs, and come out onto the corn fields.

There's no wind down here.

I see some other downsiders heading up toward the middle like me.

I look up as I walk.

The round sky is there, like always.

And the faint outline of the wire grid as well.

The clouds are rolling by.

The wind may be blowing on the surface.

The clouds move because of the wind.

A lot of songs from when people lived up there long ago talk about the wind.

I'm sure it must have had some kind of meaning for people back then.

Lowering my gaze slightly, I see the neat, gleaming wall of the top side.

Below that, the middle side.

Then I turn my eyes straight ahead of me.

I can hear my footsteps on the ground.

Wind blows underground sometimes, but it's just the flow of air coming from the tunnels connecting to the next town.

There are no gently rolling clouds here.

It's just cold air moving around.

I wonder what it's like.

The feel of the wind on your face.

Having it ruffle your hair.

I...

We...

We only know about it from what's written.

When I get up to the middle side, I go to see what work I've been assigned.

I get sent to help clean the eastern common area again today.

I take a broom and a dustpan then head to my assigned spot.

I look up at the monitor in the common area as I sweep the floor.

It displays the intensity of the UV rays on the surface.

The meter's up to the red part of the bar that means it's in the danger zone.

I've never seen it go down below the danger zone.

That's why we live underground.

On the top of the same screen is a bar that shows how much of the day's water ration has been consumed.

It's still morning, and it's already over 70%.

Today is going to be another day where there isn't any water left by nightfall.

And then, the screen switches to an image of the surface.

Something red is moving along the brown earth.
Kaito
Ah...

It's a car.

It's a video of a car.

I stop to stare at the video.

The wheels are turning really fast.

How do you make something move that fast?

And what are those shiny parts made of?

The scenery speeds by at a dizzying pace.

I've never seen something move that fast.
Kaito
Ouch!
????
Stop daydreaming and get cleaning.

Someone hits me on the back of the head.

I turn around to see a familiar pair.

It's Shachi and his android.
Kaito
...Sorry.

I turn my back on them and continue sweeping the stone floor.

But as soon as I do, he smacks the back of my head again.
Kaito
I'm working like I'm supposed to now. Why did you hit me?
Shachi
Punishment for your stupid mom slacking off. She's getting rations without working, isn't she?
Kaito
She's not slacking off... She can't move.
Kaito
She got her exemption and everything.
Shachi
Yeah, right. She's just pretending. That's why you're such a lazy idiot. Like mother, like son.
Kaito
No.

The angrier I feel, the quieter my voice gets.
Shachi
Says the boy skipping school.
Kaito
No...
Shachi
No what?! Huh?!
Kaito
...
Shachi
...

I realize I've stopped sweeping again and quickly resume my work.
Shachi
Hmph. Lame.
Shachi
Shame I gotta go to school. I sure I wish I was born to a family of slackers that let me do whatever I want.
Kaito
...

With that last remark, he leaves.

I hear his footsteps growing distant.
Shachi
Hey, Izumo! Stop standing around!

I can hear his voice, a good distance away now.

And after that, I hear the sound of Izumo's footsteps as she walks away.

I turn around and see her following Shachi.
Kaito
Mommy isn't slacking off...

I mutter, my heart heavy with frustration.

But nobody hears me, and saying it doesn't make me feel any better.

I finish my morning shift, and then eat the rations I'm given for lunch while still standing up.

We often get boiled, mushy cornflakes.

I finish eating and go check in for the afternoon shift.

By this time, the downsider kids who have finished school are arriving at work as well.

I'm the only kid that's been working since the morning.

Our family isn't eating for free.

I do the work of two people.

That's why I go home with rations for both me and mommy.

The afternoon work I get assigned is the maintenance of the shared monitors.

We work together with adults when it's complicated work like that.

They replace some parts that were starting to wear down.

After cleaning up, we're tasked with collecting the garbage in bags and taking it down to the lower layer.

That's where the trash dump is.
Kaito
Ah...

I notice some trash that wasn't here yesterday.

I dump my bag and start hunting around.
Kaito
What is this?

I find a stick-shaped thing connected to a switch. When I press it, the stick vibrates a whole lot.
Kaito
Huh?

A small brush thing is lying nearby.

It looks like you could attach it to the top of the stick.
Kaito
Oh, a toothbrush?

I turn it on and off several times.

Each time, the stick vibrates and makes a funny sound.

I stow the stick part, the one that seems to be the main part of the toothbrush, in my bag.
Kaito
Is there anything else in here?

The topsiders and midsiders throw away all kinds of things that you can still use.

Every time I disassemble electrical appliances, I find parts that work.

It's how I get my hands on parts that you never usually see down here.

If I can gather enough electronic components to make something people would want, I can barter with them in the lower market.
Kaito
Hmm, is that all for today?

I get up and leave the dump.

Now that work is done for the day, I just have to wait until it's time to pick up the rations.

This is my little alone time.

I take the stick-shaped electric toothbrush out of my bag along with my screwdriver.

I insert the screwdriver into a gap in the thing's exterior, and the stick splits in two after applying some force.

Inside, I find a small green plate and two tubular pieces of metal.
Kaito
It's rusty...

The pieces of metal have brown spots on them.

When I press the switch, the small metal tubes begin shaking.
Kaito
Whoa!

I place the shaking part on the palm of my hand.

I notice a white plastic piece at the tip of the cylinder. When I touch it, the shaking stops.

There's some resistance, I think.

When I let go, it starts shaking again.
Kaito
Oh, so it's supposed to spin? It's shaking because the middle part is out of place.

I turn the switch off and remove the plastic from the tip.

When I turn it on again, the part produces an even louder noise and turns around faster.
Kaito
Maybe...

I could use this to make wheels turn.

If I attach a wheel to the end of this, it could make a wheel move like what I saw on the monitor today.

I pull out a small wheel from my bag.

I found it some time ago while looking through garbage in the dump.

I also take out a bit of putty I got while helping repair a water pipe in the middle side.

I put some putty inside the small hole in the wheel, and then insert the rotating cylinder.

I hold it together until it hardens and then let go.

It's fixed in place now.

Then, I turn it on.
Kaito
It's spinning!

I'm so happy I shout.

The wheel spins rapidly.

Just like I saw in the video. It's so fast that I can't even see the pattern in the wheel anymore.
Kaito
So if I can put three more of these together...

I can make a moving car!

This is my first step towards becoming an inventor.

I smile at my little spinning wheel.
Kaito
It's amazing....
Kaito
Ah...

The bell that signals it's time to pick up the rations rings.

I put the tools and parts back in my bag and run to the middle side square.
Chief
Hey, Kaito! You manage to fix it?
Kaito
Yeah, it works now.

Some days ago, the nice old man that helps distribute the rations asked me to repair the flashlight he keeps attached to his belt.
Kaito
The light bulb was dead, so I replaced it with one I picked up in the dump.

I hand it over, and he flips the switch to make sure it works. When the light comes on, he smiles at me.
Chief
Oh, you're a lifesaver! I can't walk the tunnels without my little pal here.
Chief
What can I help you with today?
Kaito
I'd like some soap for washing hair. The one that smells nice and you don't need to use water with.
Chief
Soap? Sure thing. And here's today's rations. For you and your mom.
Kaito
Thanks.
Chief
Don't drop them now! Good work, sonny.

After receiving the rations, I hurry back home.

Mommy's waiting for me.

I have lots of things to tell her about today.

I run all the way back home every day, since I know she's waiting.

I want to see her as soon as possible too.
Kaito
I'm back!

When I open the door, Mom turns to me and smiles.
Mom
Welcome home. Did you work hard today, sweetie?
Kaito
Yeah! Are you hungry?

She slowly shakes her head.
Mom
Not yet. How about you?
Kaito
Same here! Listen, I picked up a new part today.

Mommy's eyes widen in surprise.
Mom
You're still going down there? Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?
Kaito
I'm fine!

I say, pouting at her.
Kaito
I was disassembling some appliance someone in the top side threw away, and I got just what I needed!

I lean against her bedside as I talk excitedly about my day.
Kaito
I still don't have everything I need, but if I find more stuff, I can get the car moving!
Mom
Wow, that's amazing!
Kaito
It'll be my first invention! Maybe no one ever thought of it before!
Mom
Yes.
Kaito
But I'll show you when it's ready, okay? Not before.
Mom
Yes, I can't wait.

I go to the desk and grab something out of my bag.
Kaito
And I got some new soap today! I'll help you wash your hair later.
Mom
Okay…

I try to hide the tools behind me so that Mommy doesn't notice them.
Mom
Kaito?

I turn to her.
Kaito
Yeah?

She smiles sweetly at me.
Mom
Did you go to school?
Kaito
...

I look down at the car I'm building.
Mom
Did you make any friends?
Kaito
...

I silently shake my head.
Mom
Kaito?
Kaito
...I like working.
Kaito
I can get parts for my inventions. Working is more fun than school.
Mom
But I'm sure you'd have even more fun if you made some friends.
Mom
Maybe you can find someone to help with your inventions.
Mom
You may even make friends you can show your inventions to after I'm no longer—
Kaito
You're not going anywhere!

I shout back, still not facing her.
Mom
Ah...
Kaito
I'll become an inventor so we can live in the middle side. We'll get a doctor from there to look at you, and you'll get well again in no time.
Kaito
We can make your cells better with those artificial genes. So you're not going anywhere, right?
Mom
...Right.
Mom
… I can't leave you yet, no.
Kaito
Huh?
Mom
It's nothing, sweetie.
Mom
Thank you for working so hard every day for us.
Kaito
...Yeah.
Kaito
Mommy, how much can you move today?
Mom
Mmh...

After finishing dinner and wiping her clean with a towel, we start our daily routine.

We've been doing this ever since her legs stopped working.
Mom
My fingers are... all good. I can move my whole right arm. On my left... I can move from the arm down.
Kaito
You can't move your shoulder?

She makes a slightly pained expression from the exertion.
Mom
...No, I don't think I can.
Kaito
I see... But it hasn't gotten worse. At least that's good.
Mom
Mm.
Kaito
It's okay. You're gonna be able to walk again someday, right?
Kaito
When I become an inventor, I'll find out what's happening and find a cure. I promise.

She smiles gently at me.
Mom
Yes, I know you will. Thank you, sweetie.
Kaito
...

Friends...

I remember what Mommy told me last night.

I'm sure she's worried because I have no friends.

I don't need any, but I don't want her to worry.

In my mind, I see the other kids from the lower side, the ones that come to work in the afternoon.

But I don't think any of them could be my friend.

Everyone's busy enough with their own families to care about others.

Looking for a chance to change their lives and move up to the middle side.

All the midsiders are young and beautiful.

The topsiders probably look the same too.

They combine artificial genes with chips in their bodies that monitor their health all the time. That's how they repair their cells as soon as they age.

But we lowsiders don't get medical care like that.

Maybe...

If we could improve Mommy's cells with artificial genes, she could move again.

The lifespan of the midsiders and topsiders is almost double that of us lowsiders, I heard.

That's why there's always such fierce competition whenever there's a vacancy in the middle side.

I think there are also fights when people try to move from the middle side to the top side, but it's more complicated, so I don't know much about it.

But since everybody's just looking out for themselves, there's no way we can be friends.

We're stuck in this pecking order. Making friends in a system like that is hard.
Kaito
Maybe I could invent myself some friends…

Like the android that's always walking behind Shachi.

Topsider families usually get one personal-use android per household, or sometimes one for each family member.

Would that count as a friend?
Kaito
It'd be fun to have one, I guess.

Can you even make an android from scratch?

I wonder what the skin they have is made out of.

It's pretty rare, but apparently people sometimes throw androids that are beyond repair down to the dump.

I go there every day, but I've never seen one.

After finishing my morning work, I go down to the dump.

Maybe I can find another one of those turning metal thingies.

No one comes down here during lunch break.

It's more efficient to look now, before the afternoon garbage gets dumped.

I head down to the dump, not even taking the time to eat my lunch.

The dump is already full of stuff that wasn't here yesterday.
Kaito
...

No androids.

I don't think one has been seen here in years.

There's no reason one would fall from the sky right now just because I need a friend.

Besides, I don't want something as big as an android today.

I start searching through the garbage.
Kaito
Okay...

Of course, there's no way I'd be lucky enough to find three of the exact same piece.

But I manage to dig deep into the mountains of trash I couldn't get to yesterday and find four similar pieces.

And two of them still work when I flip the power on.

One of the other two didn't turn on when I flipped its switch. And the last, I couldn't figure out where its switch was.

All of them are slightly different sizes.

Maybe they were all made at different times.

I put the four pieces in my bag.

Now I have a total of five electric toothbrush parts in my bag.

Finding them took longer than I expected.

Maybe everyone got their afternoon jobs assigned already.

I leave the dump and run up the stairs to the middle side again.

I'm out of breath by the time I make it to the crowd of workers in the square.

I check for my name in the work sheets and find out I'm assigned to cleaning duty.

I guess I'm cleaning all day today.

The nice thing about working alone is that you can control how long the job takes.

If you finish early, no one minds if you take a break.

I'm in a hurry to disassemble all the toothbrushes I found.

I brought the base of the car I'm making with me too.

When I attach the moving wheels to it, it'll be a real car.

I pick up a broom and go to the west part of the square that I'm supposed to clean.
Shachi
Hey, Octopus! You're not slacking off today, huh?
Kaito
My name is Kaito. Like a kite in the sky.
Shachi
Who cares about your name? You're an octopus now.
Shachi
You're not gonna freaking fly anywhere, you're just gonna go wiggle into a hole down in the low side and stay there like the slippery, disgusting octopus you are.
Kaito
...What's an octopus?

Is it some kind of toy?
Shachi
Hah! You don't know what an octopus is?! Well, I guess you don't go to school! That's why you're so stupid!
Kaito
I'm not stupid.
Shachi
You downsiders are all stupid.
Kaito
...
Shachi
Octopus.
Kaito
...

I carry on cleaning and try to ignore him.
Shachi
Heheh.
Izumo
...
Kaito
...

Eventually Shachi goes off to make fun of the other downsiders, but Izumo remains where she is, staring at me.
Kaito
What?
Izumo
Octopus are marine mollusks. They have eight legs. Although they are invertebrates, they are highly intelligent. They were also a source of food in various cultures.
Kaito
Oh.

Then she falls silent, and just stares at me.
Shachi
Izumo! What are you doing? I'm gonna smash your stupid head in!
Kaito
Your friend's calling you.
Izumo
He's not my friend. "Owner" and "friend" are distinct classifications.
Kaito
...
Shachi
Izumo!

Izumo turns around and walks back to Shachi.
Kaito
...

Even after they're gone, I continue staring in the direction they left.

Octopus are marine mollusks. They have eight legs.

Although they are invertebrates, they are highly intelligent. They were also a source of food in various cultures.

I can still almost hear Izumo's mechanical tone in my head.

It might be nice to have a friend like that, one who could tell you things you didn't know.

It would make learning a lot more fun.

I keep daydreaming about it as I clean.
Kaito
Okay, it's ready...

Just like I thought, the insides of the toothbrushes are pretty much the same.

All of them have that rotating part, a switch, and a power source.

Some work and some don't.

I swap some of the parts from one to another, until I figure out which is the power source.

The reason they're not moving is because there's no energy left in them.
Kaito
Okay, I got them all!

Now I have for rotating metal parts.

And I've attached four wheels of the same size to one end of each of them.

I turn on their respective switches.

All of them work.
Kaito
Yes, I did it!

I take out the base of the car and use putty to attach all the wheels.

I make sure to stick all the wheels to the four corners of the rectangular base.

It's getting closer and closer to the car I saw in the video.

I bet I can find something like what was on top of the car I saw in the video by searching through topsiders' trash.

The topsiders throw away all kinds of things I can't work out a use for. Most of it seems like pointless decorations.
Kaito
...

I turn on the switches for each wheel one by one.

All of them start spinning rapidly.
Kaito
...

I slowly put the car on the ground, and then...

It rushes off... in circles on the spot I placed it down on.
Kaito
H-Huh? I-It's supposed to go forward...
Kaito
Wh-Why?
????
Ahahah! That's funny!
Kaito
Huh?!
????
It's spinning round and round.

My head turns towards the source of the voice, and I see a girl with pure white hair looking at me.

I quickly pick the car back up and hide it behind my back.
Kaito
I-It's nothing.
????
Is that a car? It is, right? It wasn't moving forward, though.
Kaito
...

Does she know about cars?
????
That's amazing. You made it yourself in the workshop?
Kaito
How do you know?
????
Huh?
Kaito
H-How do you know it's a car?
????
Huh? I read about it in a history book.
Kaito
Uh...
????
I read a whole lot, you know?!
Kaito
...

History books?

Oh...

There's a kid other than me that knows about cars.
????
That car moves, right? It's incredible.
Kaito
...It's still not done.
????
How did you make it?
Kaito
It's a secret...
????
What?! Why?!

The girl howls at me.

But a second later she's all smiles again.
????
You're so smart! It's amazing!
Kaito
No it's not. It won't even move like it's supposed to.
????
You didn't want to make a car that spins in circles?

I shake my head.
Kaito
I wanted it to go in a straight line.
????
Why not try it again? Maybe it just didn't feel like it that time.
Kaito
...

I look down at the car I'm hiding, think for a moment, then turn it on again and place it on the ground.
Kaito
...

It just spins in place, same as before.
????
Look at that spin!
Kaito
It's a failure...

I pick the car up again and turn it off.
????
Let me take a look at it.

Just then, I hear another unfamiliar voice.

I turn and look up to see who it is.

The girl turns in the same direction as me.
????
Hi, Professor Asuma.

The man smiles at the girl.

He looks a little younger than Mommy.

The man she called Professor Asuma looks at the car in my hands.
Asuma
You made that? Can I take a look?
Kaito
...

I look down at my feet.
Asuma
Hahah, I'm not gonna take it away from you. I'd just like to see the work of a tiny inventor.
Kaito
...You mean me?
Asuma
Who else?
Kaito
...

I nod and hand the car to him.
Asuma
Hahah, I see. You attached all the motors directly to the tires?
Kaito
Motor?

The man makes his finger swirl in a circular motion.
Asuma
This is what's called a motor. It has a magnet inside. When an electric current runs through it, the magnet spins.
Kaito
...
Asuma
And you have all of these motors spinning clockwise right now. If you want it to run forward, you need to reverse the rotation of two of the motors on one side so they all go in the same direction.
Asuma
If you put motors rotating the same way on both sides, the right and left wheels will spin in different directions, right?
Kaito
Ah, I see...
????
This is too complicated. I don't get it.
Kaito
But how do I do that?
Asuma
If you reverse the direction of the current, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction.
Asuma
You have any pliers on you?

I nod and take out some pliers from my bag.
Asuma
I'll cut the cables, okay?

I nod at him again.

The man cuts the cables connecting the two motors on the left side, switches them, and wraps them around the bare metal pieces.
Asuma
It would be better if we could solder this bit.
Asuma
But now it should run straight.

The man says, before crouching and putting the car on the ground.

The car wavers side to side as it moves in kind of a straight line.
Kaito
It's running! ...But it's stuttering.
Asuma
The four motors all have different specs, and their batteries have different voltages. Each of the wheels is moving on its own, so it's not going perfectly straight.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Now, what to do? Perhaps you could use one motor to send the same amount of power to all four wheels.
Kaito
How?!
Asuma
By using gears.
Kaito
Gears?
Asuma
Yeah, like this.

The man picks up a stick from the ground and uses it to draw something on the floor.
Asuma
The rotation of one motor is transmitted to an axle with two wheels attached to it.
Asuma
Now you've got only one source of energy and motive power. It's much more efficient.
Asuma
If you want more power, you can connect two axles with a gear, so that the torque from one motor can power them both.
Kaito
Torque?
Asuma
Simply put, it's the power to make things rotate. Think of it like that for now.
Asuma
You'd need a strong motor, but since the rotational force is transmitted to all the wheels, it'll keep going even if one of the wheels gets stuck in a hole.
Asuma
That's how four-wheel drive vehicles work.
Kaito
Wow, I see... So you only need one motor.

The man smiles and nods.
Asuma
The most important quality of an inventor is being able to use your own brain and try things for yourself. And you did that magnificently. You should be proud.
Kaito
...
Asuma
But you also need to remember one thing a good inventor should never do.
Kaito
What is that?
Asuma
Try to reinvent the wheel, my boy. There's no point in wasting time inventing something that already exists.
Asuma
I bet you would have liked to know about motors and gears sooner, right?

I answer with a nod.
Asuma
We rely on the wisdom of those who came before us, and we stand on the shoulders of giants.
Asuma
That's why humanity made books and schools to pass down knowledge.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Here. This is your own precious invention.

The man returns my car.
Kaito
Th-Thanks.
Asuma
Keep at it.
????
See you later, Professor!

The man smiles at the girl and walks off.
????
That was great, huh?
Kaito
Who was that?
????
Professor Asuma. He's a school principal and a great researcher.
Kaito
School principal? He works at a school?
????
Hey, what's your name? Don't you go to school?

I shake my head.
????
I can't believe it! But you're so smart!
Kaito
...
????
My name is Yonagi. It means 'calm world.'
Kaito
Yonagi...
Yonagi
Calm as in a lull in the sea, so it means more like calm ocean. It's pretty, isn't it?
Kaito
...
Yonagi
What's your name?
Kaito
...Kaito.
Yonagi
Kaito! Like the name of the character in that picture book. I love that book!

I nod.
Kaito
That's where it comes from. Me and my mom like it a lot.
Yonagi
That's great! Does it mean anything?
Kaito
Um, it's supposed to be like a kite flying in the sky.
Kaito
So that one day I can fly up to the sky and bring all the people from the low side up to the surface, and we can all look at the sea together.

Even as the words leave my mouth, I'm already cringing with embarrassment.

In fact... Yonagi is just standing there, silently.

It sounds ridiculous.

I'm fully aware of it myself.
Yonagi
That's awesome!
Kaito
Huh?

I look up and see her eyes wide open, glittering like shiny jewels.

For the first time, I realize her eyes are red.
Yonagi
Who named you?! I wanna know!
Kaito
My mom...
Yonagi
It's so cool! I love it! Let's be friends, Kaito!
Kaito
...Why?
Yonagi
Why?! I bet your mom is super amazing! She has to be, if she gave you a name like that!
Yonagi
And I bet you're a good boy if you have such nice parents!
Kaito
What's that supposed to mean...?

I look down at my feet again.

Hearing someone say such nice things about Mommy makes me so happy I could cry.

Yonagi's the first person ever to say something nice about her.
Yonagi
We have really good names, don't you think?
Yonagi
My daddy's the one who named me!
Kaito
...I see.
Yonagi
Oh, there's the ration bell. Gotta go.
Kaito
You're a lowsider too?
Yonagi
Yeah.

She nods, still smiling at me.

The midsiders and the topsiders get their food delivered directly to their homes.

Only the lowsiders have to get in line to receive rations.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Okay, I'm off. See you later!
Kaito
O-Okay...

She turns and runs off toward the middle side square.
Kaito
...

What a strange girl.

And...

This has been the most interesting lunch break I've ever had.
Kaito
Gears...

I try to recall the mechanism that Asuma guy explained.

I just want it to run straight first, so two gears should be enough.

One gear attached to the motor, and then another attached to the axle.

I could see why you'd only need one motor to power the car if you used this mechanism.

I wonder if I could have figured this out myself without that man's help.

Maybe not.
Kaito
Reinventing the wheel...

Maybe there's a limit to what I can do on my own.

And...

Maybe attending school could help me become an inventor faster.

I slowly walk back home, rations in hand.
Kaito
I'm back.
Mom
Welcome home, sweetie.
Kaito
...
Mom
Mm? Did something happen?

I nod, wordlessly.
Mom
What is it? Anything bad?

I shake my head.
Kaito
Nothing bad. Just thinking of something.
Mom
I see. Do you want to talk about it?

I nod and sit by her bed.

Mommy patiently waits for me to talk.

I try to think of how to explain.

Where should I begin?

How should I say it?

I keep thinking for a while.
Kaito
Mmm...
Mom
Hm?
Kaito
When you were a kid, did you go to school?

When I ask, Mommy's eyes widen and she smiles.

The same gentle smile that she always has for me.
Mom
Yeah, I did.
Kaito
And there were teachers?
Mom
Of course.
Kaito
What kind of people were they?
Mom
Back when I was studying, there were a lot of teachers that were really good at making things.
Kaito
Really?
Mom
Yep.
Kaito
Like how?
Mom
For example, they taught us how to make our own bags.
Kaito
Ah...

I look over at my bag, which is hanging on the wall.

Mommy made it for me when I started working in the middle side.
Kaito
The teachers taught you that?
Mom
Just the basics, yes. Once you learn a few different ways to sew, you can make whatever you want with the right materials.
Kaito
...

I remember the man's words again.

Reinventing the wheel.

The one thing an inventor shouldn't do.

That's why there are schools.
Kaito
But there were topsiders and midsiders there, right?
Mom
Yes, there were.
Kaito
Did bad things happen?
Mom
Sometimes, yes.
Kaito
...
Mom
But it was still really fun. I made so many friends.
Kaito
Friends...
Mom
Yes. We made clothes together, and we would wear them and play together.
Mom
Well, like you said, it wasn't all fun and games.
Kaito
Yeah.
Mom
But you know how I'm here all the time now, right?
Kaito
Mhm.
Mom
These days... I'm really jealous of the people that can walk outside on their own.
Mom
If I had known this would happen, I would have liked to visit so many more places and see so many more things.
Kaito
But the top side and the middle side aren't fun for us.
Mom
Even so, I think I would have liked to make sure of that for myself.
Kaito
...

Mom patiently waits for me to talk.
Kaito
Today... I failed at making the car.
Mom
Car...? You mean that little version of the thing people on the surface used to move around?

I nod.
Kaito
The car didn't run straight. I wanted to make it work on my own...
Kaito
But I learned that people already found a better way to make cars long ago.
Mom
...
Kaito
Someone taught me that.
Kaito
The principal of the school.
Mom
I see.
Kaito
He told me that reinventing the wheel wasn't good.
Mom
Reinventing the wheel?
Kaito
It means that I was looking for something that people already found a way of doing.
Kaito
Because I didn't know people had figured it out.
Kaito
I realized that I'll never make anything new if I'm always focusing on things that might already exist.
Mom
Kaito.
Kaito
Mhm?
Mom
You really are going to be an inventor. I saw it just now.
Kaito
What do you mean?
Mom
I saw what you'll be like when you're all grown up.
Kaito
Huh?
Mom
You'll become everything you want to be. No matter what.
Kaito
Why? How do you know that?
Mom
I told you, I saw it!
Kaito
You don't know that.
Mom
Oh, but I do. Mom always knows.

She says, smiling down at me.
Kaito
There's lots of books in school, right?

Mommy nods.
Kaito
And there's also a place called a workshop, right?
Mom
Did that teacher tell you about it?
Kaito
The girl I met today mentioned it.

Her eyebrows rise when I mention the girl.
Mom
A girl? Does she go to school?

I nod.
Mom
What kind of girl?
Kaito
I don't know. We didn't talk that much.
Mom
I see.
Kaito
She said she wanted to...
Mom
Mhm?
Kaito
To be friends with me.
Mom
And?
Kaito
I didn't say anything back.
Mom
...
Kaito
...
Mom
Do you want to be friends with her?
Kaito
I don't know.
Kaito
But...
Mom
...

I bet your mom is super amazing! She has to be, if she gave you a name like that!
Kaito
...

I can still hear Yonagi's words in my head.

Just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm gonna cry.

I feel my throat tighten, but I manage to hold back the tears.
Kaito
I think I wouldn't mind being friends with her.
Kaito
Maybe.
Kaito
...
Mom
Oh, sweetie.

When I look up again, Mommy's smile looks brighter than ever.

I get a little shy and look down at my hands again.
Kaito
...

Yonagi.

I wonder if I'll see her again today.

...

I mean, she has to go to the middle side.

We lowsiders aren't allowed to skip work without good reason. We're not allowed to take a day off just because.

That's our role in the system.

That's why everyone keeps doing their jobs, dreaming of going up to the middle side someday.

Above us is the middle side.

And above them, a really small number of top siders.

And above them, there's the big round blue sky.

At the end of the picture book, Kaito made it to a place where the sky and the sea went on forever.

The story ends when he's surrounded by nothing but the endless blue.

...

I wonder, though.

Will I ever see what he saw?

No, I can't think like that.

I'll get there, no matter what.

I lower my gaze a little.

I see the big mansions on the top side.

And then, lower down, the buildings of the middle side.

First, I have to get us there.

If I become a researcher, I can live in the middle side.

When I look straight ahead, corn stalks taller than my head fill my vision.

I can't see anything but this right now.

But someday, I'll get there.

I grip the strap of the bag Mommy made for me and walk up to the middle side.

My morning job is maintenance of the water pipes.

The ones in the west area are getting worn out.

It's been a year since I last did this kind of work.

I was working together with a group of adults, but all of them knew I don't go to school, so it wasn't awkward or anything.

When I go to gather some tools together in the square, I come upon a group of kids heading to school.

Shachi is among them, followed by Izumo like always.
Shachi
Stop lazing around. We have enough slackers with your stupid mom.

Shachi hits me across the back of the head for no reason, and I hear some of the other kids laughing.

I ignore them, grab the tools, and leave.

The adults in my group stare as I make my way back to them.
Chief
Why don't you tell that bully off?

The nice old man who hands out the rations asks me.
Chief
Your mom's exempt from work, that right?

I nod.

He's looking straight into my eyes.
Chief
If it bothers you, Kaito…
Chief
Then you should go to school. Your mom's exempt from work, so you're allowed to go to school in the mornings.
Chief
Remember that.

Not knowing what to say, I simply stay silent.

The old man sighs and picks up a tool bag double the size of mine.
Chief
Let's get this over with.

Today's group is a good one.

The old man's instructions are so good that we finish the work in half the time it took last year.

I decide to use my extra time to look for gears in the garbage dump.

I wonder what kind of things I can disassemble to find the gears I need to make the car work.

I rummage through the trash.

There are some things similar to what I need, but I can't find one that's the perfect size.

I find one of those tools that adults used to use when making those black drinks they like.

It uses gears to transmit the rotations of the handle, but one of the gears is stuck to the frame, and removing it seems too complicated.

I continue searching and find a small wooden box.
Kaito
What's this?

Opening the lid, I find a lot of metal parts inside.
Kaito
Huh?

Looking closely, I see a metal shaft with spiral-shaped notches on it, and there's another part meshing with it.

It looks like a mechanism that's supposed to rotate.

It's not what I'm looking for, but maybe I can get something out of it.

I stow the wooden box into my bag.

Since we finished our morning work early, I have plenty of time to eat lunch.

I sit alone in a corner in the middle side and chew my dry tortilla.

After a while, the lowsider kids come spilling out from the school.

After most of them have passed by, Yonagi comes running to get her lunch.

She picks up a tortilla and looks for a place to sit.

That's when she notices me.

A satisfied smile spreads across her face, and she walks over to me.
Yonagi
Kaito!
Kaito
Hey.
Yonagi
You didn't come to school?
Kaito
Mhm...
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
I've never been there.
Yonagi
Mmh...
Yonagi
Can I sit?

I just nod at her.
Yonagi
You've been working here all morning?

I nod again.
Yonagi
Why?
Kaito
I have to.
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
...

I finish the last bit of my tortilla.

Yonagi keeps staring at me from the side.
Kaito
Hey.
Yonagi
Hm?
Kaito
Aren't you gonna eat?

She still hasn't taken a bite out of her tortilla.
Kaito
Ah.
Yonagi
Ah.

The bell rings to signal the end of lunch break.

Yonagi rolls up the tortilla and stuffs it all into her mouth in one go.
Kaito
Your mouth is gonna get really dry.
Yonagi
Wy kno... *Gulp*
Kaito
Heheh.

I can't help but laugh when I see her cheeks puffing out from all the food.
Kaito
Hahah! Ahahah! Hahahahah!

I can't stop laughing.

Yonagi stares at me with her cheeks full of food. Slowly, the corners of her mouth rise into a smile.

And then, her eyes twinkle and she starts laughing together with me.
Yonagi
Heheh... Heheheh... *Cough* Hahah!

Unable to hold back her laughter, Yonagi ends up spitting all the tortilla that was in her mouth all over my face.

All. Of. It.
Kaito
...

Absolutely shocked, I simply stare at her.

Her smile also disappears, and we just stare at each other for a whole minute. Then...
Yonagi
Ahah! Ahahahah! What's with the face?! Ahahah! You're all dirty and gross!
Kaito
Y-You did this to me!
Yonagi
Gross Kaito! Ahahah!
Kaito
You're the gross one! Heh... Heheh...
Yonagi
Ahah! Hahahah!

We both laugh our butts off.

When we come to, we notice that even the adults around us are laughing.

The nice old man I was working with this morning is also letting out a hearty guffaw.
Yonagi
I'm on weeding duty.

We both laugh our butts off and then head to get our tasks for the day.
Kaito
Me too.
Yonagi
I gotta work with mascara de tortilla, huh?
Kaito
What do you mean?!
Yonagi
I mean, the tortilla looked like a mask all over your face! Heheh. Ahahah!
Kaito
It was your fault!
Yonagi
I can't believe the evil mascara de tortilla stole my food!
Kaito
What does that even mean anyway?
Yonagi
It's Spanish!
Kaito
Huh? What? Why?
Yonagi
Tortillas are Mexican food, remember?
Kaito
M-Mexico?
Yonagi
It's a country.
Kaito
Country... Oh, i see.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Kaito
Got it.
Kaito
I still don't know why I'm mas-whatever de tortilla!
Yonagi
Ahahah, don't sweat it.
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
Time to work!
Yonagi
Heheh, eheheh.
Kaito
You're laughing at me again.

Our afternoon task is pulling out weeds.

Yonagi and I have been assigned to it together, and she's still all smiles from the tortilla accident just now.
Yonagi
Man, that was so funny. You're a comedic genius!
Kaito
All I did was take a tortilla to the face.
Yonagi
Ahahah!
????
What are you laughing at?

We both look behind us.

It's Shachi, with Izumo and some other midsider students behind him.

I notice that the kids all have bits of grass stuck to their clothes.

Maybe they were playing on the grass or something.
Shachi
Look, it's the albino freak.
Yonagi
I told you to not call me that back in class.
Shachi
Shut up. You lowsiders ought to shut up and work.
Yonagi
You topsiders must be so bored if you have to go roll around in the grass to have fun. That's sooo sad.
Shachi
I'm searching for something! I wouldn't come to this filthy slum if I didn't have to!
Kaito
...
Shachi
What're you looking at?!

Shachi glowers at me.
Kaito
...Nothing.
Shachi
Albino freak.
Yonagi
...
Shachi
Don't ignore me!
Yonagi
I'm not an albino freak. My name's Yonagi.
Shachi
But you're an albino, right?
Yonagi
Are you that desperate to talk to a girl? Do they usually run away from you?
Shachi
No! Are you blind?!

Shachi points at Izumo.

Yonagi shakes her head.
Yonagi
You think that's a girl?
Shachi
Th-That's not what I mean! I'm a topsider, that's why I have an android!
Yonagi
Uh?
Shachi
I'm a topsider! Everyone loves me!
Yonagi
Ahahah!
Shachi
What is it?!
Yonagi
That sounds really, really lame. Maybe you shouldn't say that out loud.
Shachi
Ugh!
Kaito
Ah...

Shachi hits her over the head.

Just like he always does with me.
Yonagi
...
Shachi
Th-That was your fault.
Yonagi
How?
Shachi
Because you're talking back and slacking off!
Yonagi
And why does that mean you can hit me?
Shachi
I...
Yonagi
The topsiders don't have any right to punish us lowsiders. You don't even know that?
Yonagi
We lowsiders work because it's our duty.
Yonagi
Did your parents not bother to teach you that?
Shachi
You stupid albino freak.

The words no sooner leave his mouth than Yonagi approaches him menacingly.
Yonagi
I don't want to be called that.
Yonagi
Stop calling me something I don't want to be called.
Shachi
...
Yonagi
Don't you dare.

Yonagi stands firm and stares him down.
Shachi
...
Yonagi
Hmph.

After a moment, Shachi turns his back on us.

He quickly leaves without another word.
Yonagi
Stupid twerp!

Yonagi shouts after Shachi's gone.
Kaito
...That was amazing.
Yonagi
What?!
Kaito
I mean, uh, how you stood up to him.
Yonagi
Even you're gonna say that?
Kaito
Well, uh, but he's a topsider.
Yonagi
Who cares?
Yonagi
If I could choose for myself, I'd choose being a lowsider with a job to do every single time!
Kaito
Why?!
Yonagi
Huh? Because it's fun! Food tastes so much better after a good day's work!
Yonagi
It's way better than just sitting around doing nothing.
Kaito
...
Kaito
I would choose to be a topsider if I could.
Yonagi
Huh?! Why?!
Kaito
I want to see the sky from up there.
Yonagi
The sky?
Kaito
And the topsiders can see the outside from the bulge of the ozone lens!
Kaito
I want to see what the surface is like with my own eyes.
Yonagi
Mm...
Yonagi
So you're interested in the surface.
Kaito
Of course! Everyone is!
Yonagi
Well, I'm not!
Kaito
You're weird.
Yonagi
Says mascara de tortilla.
Yonagi
I'm interested in something way, waaay more romantic than the surface!
Kaito
What's that?
Yonagi
Heheh.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Love!
Kaito
Love?
Yonagi
Love that makes your chest get all warm and fuzzy wuzzy when you think about it!
Kaito
Fuzzy wuzzy?
Yonagi
That's what I want.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
You know Shakespeare?
Kaito
Sh-Shake spear?
Yonagi
He was a huge genius!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
What's something that can spread out infinitely, even inside here?
Kaito
Uh, err, a virus?
Yonagi
Whoa, what a downer.
Kaito
I don't know!
Yonagi
Imagination!
Kaito
What?
Yonagi
Excitement! Heart pounding! Flashy fun!
Yonagi
If you close your eyes, you can imagine all those feelings and be wherever you want, right?
Kaito
Excitement...
Yonagi
I like it better that way.
Kaito
You're kind of weird. Really weird, actually.
Yonagi
You think so? I don't think I'm that weird.
Kaito
I think everyone here thinks about the surface.
Yonagi
Well, it's not like I wouldn't like to see what's up there.
Yonagi
But rather than what you see, isn't it more important who you see it with?
Kaito
No, it's where you see it from.
Yonagi
No! You're wrong!
Kaito
Whatever. Let's just finish work already.
Yonagi
Right-O.

We keep pulling out weeds in silence.

After we're done, we go to throw them in the dump.
Yonagi
Man, this place sure is full of trash.
Kaito
There's a bunch of stuff that can still be used.
Yonagi
Really?
Kaito
Yeah. Even if it's broken stuff, sometimes you can get good parts out of it.
Yonagi
Huh? Even though it's trash?
Kaito
Yeah. I look for stuff that people can use and trade it for food.
Kaito
The rations we get are never enough, so I search for things to trade with here.
Yonagi
There's a lot of stuff in the school's workshop. I don't use it a lot, though.
Kaito
You're talking about school again?
Yonagi
Yeah.
Kaito
...

We go back to the middle square to report that we've finished our work.
Yonagi
There's still a while left till it's time to pick up the rations.
Kaito
Yeah, I've got something to do.
Yonagi
What is it?
Kaito
...A secret.
Yonagi
Why?!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
I thought we were friends!
Kaito
W-We are?
Yonagi
Huh? We're not?
Kaito
...
Yonagi
...

She tilts her head to the side and looks into my eyes.
Yonagi
Didn't I say we yesterday that we should be friends?
Kaito
Yeah, but...
Yonagi
And you even caught all of my tortilla with your face!
Kaito
What does that have to do with anything?
Yonagi
How doesn't it?! You're telling me you'd take a tortilla to the face from just anyone?
Kaito
I don't want to get food spat on my face even from a friend!
Yonagi
Ahahah!
Yonagi
Makes sense!
Kaito
...

I take out the base of the car from my bag.
Yonagi
Ah, it's the car.
Kaito
I wanna try out what that man said yesterday.
Yonagi
You mean Professor Asuma?

I nod.
Yonagi
You found gears?

I fish out the wooden box I picked up this morning.
Kaito
I'll disassemble this to get them.
Yonagi
Ooh, show me!

I pass it to her.

She looks at the box from every angle before opening it.
Yonagi
Whoa, it's a music box!
Kaito
A what?
Yonagi
It's called a music box!
Yonagi
But it looks like it's broken. This part here is supposed to spin and make a nice sound.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
You're gonna take it apart? I think it's really pretty.
Kaito
Yeah. I can replace the parts I take out later. I just want some of them for the car right now.
Yonagi
Oh, I see.

She hands the box back to me.

I take out my flat-head screwdriver and begin taking the music box apart.
Kaito
There, I got it.

I put the spiral-shaped shaft with notches on it and the gear that meshed with it on the palm of my hand.
Yonagi
Oooh!
Kaito
Now I attach this to the motor. See? This shaft thing.
Kaito
It turns, see?
Yonagi
Ooh!
Kaito
Now...

I remove the four motors from the car's body.

I also remove the wheels attached to the motors.

I choose the fastest of the motors and attach the gear to its tip.

Then I use putty to attach tires to both ends of the shaft, and position the motor and the power source so that the gear will mesh with it.
Yonagi
It looks like clay.
Kaito
It's putty. It's harder than clay.
Yonagi
You're so good at this!
Kaito
I've spent a lot of time doing this stuff.
Kaito
Okay...
Kaito
It's turning!
Yonagi
Whoa!

It's incredible.

The rotation of one motor is transmitted to the two wheels.

The gear transmits that rotation to the shaft, and in turn, makes the wheels turn.

The parts look beautiful working together at such high speed.
Yonagi
Let's make it run!
Kaito
Yeah...

I gingerly place the car on the ground.
Yonagi
Oooh!
Kaito
It's running!
Yonagi
It's incredible! You're a genius!
Kaito
It's working!
Yonagi
Let's show it to the Professor! I'm sure he'll love it.
Kaito
Mhm...
Yonagi
You're super smart! I bet you can get chosen for the engineering course!
Kaito
What's that?
Yonagi
It's where all researchers start out!
Kaito
Really? Lowsiders can enter?
Yonagi
If you study enough, yeah!
Kaito
I see. So I could become a midsider that way.
Yonagi
That's not the part that matters! It means you can become a scientist and research whatever you want!
Yonagi
It doesn't matter if you're a midsider or a lowsider or whatever.
Kaito
...

I don't think that way.

I'm just amazed that there's a concrete way to get to the middle side.

Or at least a chance.

Suddenly, that's all I can think about.
Kaito
An engineering course...
Yonagi
Yeah.
Kaito
Does that Professor from yesterday teach it?
Yonagi
I think so, maybe.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
Hey, why don't you come to school?
Kaito
Because I have no friends.
Yonagi
Awh...

She squints at me and pouts.
Kaito
You are my friend, though.

Yonagi beams at me upon hearing that.
Kaito
But it doesn't seem fun to go to school with those guys, though.
Yonagi
What a waste!
Kaito
But you don't like them either, right?
Kaito
If you like working, you could just work all day like me.
Yonagi
I like working, but I like reading lots of books just as much!
Yonagi
I wanna read lots of books, but it'd be such a waste if I didn't just because I'm scared of some jerks!
Yonagi
It's not like I have any friends in school either.
Kaito
Really?
Yonagi
Yeah.
Kaito
...Oh.

I assumed she had lots of friends.

Since she's so bright and cheerful, I figured she'd always be the center of attention.
Kaito
You read books in school all day?
Yonagi
Yeah!
Yonagi
You wanna study more too, right?
Yonagi
You looked like you were having tons of fun listening to Professor Asuma yesterday.
Kaito
It was fun, yeah.
Yonagi
Then let's go to school together!
Kaito
But...

I look down at my handmade car.

I do wanna see that workshop.

I didn't even know lowsiders could become researchers.

But...

I shake my head.
Kaito
I can't go. I have to work for my mom too.

Yonagi looks surprised.
Yonagi
Why?
Kaito
She can't walk.
Kaito
That's why I have to work for two people.
Yonagi
Is she sick?

I nod.
Yonagi
Doesn't she have an exemption from work?
Kaito
She does, but...
Yonagi
Mm?

I hang my head, but Yonagi tries to peer into my face from below.
Kaito
They say my mom's slacking... It makes me so frustrated...

The expression drains from her face.
Yonagi
Who said that to you?
Kaito
...Shachi. That's why I work instead of going to school.
Yonagi
Kaito.

Yonagi says my name calmly.

She looks into my eyes and slowly shakes her head.
Yonagi
That's the same as accepting that they're right.
Kaito
...Why?
Yonagi
Everyone who lives in this city has the right to not work if they're sick like your mom.
Yonagi
I get why you feel that way, but what you're doing won't solve anything.
Yonagi
And I don't think it makes your mom happy.
Kaito
Why not?! How would you even know that?!
Yonagi
I just know. I know how it feels.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Kaito, let's go to school together, okay?
Yonagi
I'm sure you can stand up to all those dummies.
Yonagi
And I'm sure you'll have fun! You can learn so many things from reading, and you can make whatever you can think of!
Yonagi
That's what school is for.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Okay?

The smile returns to Yonagi's face.

I give her a small nod.

Seeing this, her smile spreads even wider.
Kaito
Okay, I'll try.
Yonagi
Yes! Yes!
Kaito
I'll put in an application when it's time to get the rations.
Kaito
I'll ask if I can go to school in the mornings, starting tomorrow.
Yonagi
Of course you can! You have the right to!

Before lining up for rations, I talk to the people that decide on the tasks we do every day.

One of them is the nice old man who helped with the maintenance of the water pipes.

When I say I want to go to school, all the adults there seem happy and relieved at the news.
Chief
That's good. You ought to be in school at your age.
Kaito
Yeah... Thanks.
Chief
Don't let those topsiders spook you. You're a talented young man if I've ever seen one.
Kaito
...
Chief
If they dare say anything about your mom, you bash their faces in! We're all on your side here, sonny.
Kaito
Okay. I'll do my best.
Chief
Go and hit those books!
Chief
You can get up there, I just know it.

I never imagined all the people I work with would be so supportive.

I pick up my rations and go back to Yonagi.
Yonagi
How did it go? Did they say it's okay?

I nod.
Yonagi
Yes! Then let's go together! I can show you around.
Kaito
Okay.

We both walk through the fields with our ration pots.

All the other kids except for us are walking with their parents.

All of us lowsiders do some kind of labor.

The men usually work in power generation plants or factory zones at the end of long tunnels, and they don't come out for days at a time.
Kaito
Hey, so...
Yonagi
Yeah?
Kaito
Are you like me?
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
Your mom and dad don't seem to be around.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Kaito
Neither of them?
Yonagi
Nope. I used to live with my dad, but he died.
Kaito
...I see.
Kaito
So you're alone?
Yonagi
Yeah, but I have all the stuff they left behind, and I can keep eating as long as I work.
Kaito
Aren't you lonely?

If Mommy died...

I don't think I could take it.

I don't even want to imagine it.

But Yonagi shakes her head.
Yonagi
I have a lot of fun. And now you're my friend too.
Kaito
...Mhm.
Yonagi
Let's go to school together starting tomorrow, okay?
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
We can meet at the elevator tomorrow morning.
Kaito
Okay.

We agree on a time to meet.
Yonagi
I gotta go this way now.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
I wanna come play at your house sometime, so you better tell your mom all about me!
Kaito
O-Okay.
Yonagi
See you tomorrow!

Yonagi shouts before running off along a dirt street rimmed by tightly-packed buildings.

I see her off and then continue on through the cornfield.
Kaito
And then her cheeks puffed up like this! They were all round!
Kaito
When I laughed, she laughed, and she spit out the tortilla all over my face!
Mom
No way! Hahah!
Kaito
She spit out all of it! I couldn't believe it!
Kaito
Yonagi was laughing so hard, and so was I, and then everyone in the square was laughing.
Mom
Ahahahah!
Kaito
And then Yonagi called me Mascara de Tortilla all day, even though it was her fault!
Mom
Mascara de Tortilla?

I nod.
Kaito
She says it's Spanish. Because tortilla is a Mexican food.
Mom
Oooh. I... see?
Kaito
Yeah.

When I got back home, I spent the whole evening talking about Yonagi.

Mommy simply listens to me with a smile on her face.
Mom
Yonagi knows so many things, huh?
Kaito
Yeah. She said she reads a lot.
Kaito
I think she's as smart as me.
Mom
That's incredible!
Mom
I'd like to meet her sometime.
Kaito
Huh?
Mom
Yonagi.
Kaito
...
Kaito
I'll tell her tomorrow. She said she wants to visit too.
Kaito
I'll see her tomorrow at school.
Mom
Huh?
Kaito
...
Mom
You're going to school tomorrow?

I hang my head and nod.
Mom
Oh, I see.
Kaito
...

I say nothing, my head still down.

Mom gently strokes my hair.
Mom
Ask her tomorrow then, okay?
Kaito
Yeah. Can you read me a book today?
Mom
Sure, what do you want to read?
Kaito
The one about Kaito. From the beginning.
Mom
Sure thing. Bring the book over here.

When I present the book about Kaito's adventure to Mommy...
Mom
Ah...

Her left arm was hanging weakly at her side.
Kaito
...
Mom
Hmm... I can move my right hand. My left hand too. My right arm is... fine.
Kaito
Mhm.
Mom
But my left arm... Nngh, ah...
Kaito
...
Mom
Ugh...
Kaito
You can't move it?
Mom
No, though I can move my fingers.
Kaito
You could move everything below the shoulder before, right?
Mom
Yeah.
Kaito
...
Mom
Ngh...
Kaito
But maybe it'll start moving again tomorrow. Maybe you're just tired.
Mom
...Right.
Mom
Thank you, sweetie. Why don't we go to bed for tonight?
Kaito
Okay.

Mommy stares out the window for a while.

Maybe she's having a hard time falling asleep.

But after a while, I hear her breathing even out.

After making sure she's asleep, I put the car on the desk.

I flip the switch, and the two wheels start turning.

I turn it on and off several times to make sure every part of it works properly.
Kaito
Good...

Now there's only one thing left.

The part that covers the top.

I recall the car I saw on the middle side's monitor.

The part that glittered under the sunlight.

I don't think I can make that from putting spare parts together.

What is it even made out of to begin with?

Metal? Plastic?
Kaito
...

Yonagi said there's lots of books in school.

Can I learn what I want to know there?

I want to learn about cars.

And, most importantly, I want to find out what Mommy's illness is.

I didn't know there were so many books at school, or that lowsiders could read them too.

I lie down and stare at the ceiling.

School...

I think about Mommy's arm again.

There are so many things I need to learn about.

I want to get us to the middle side.

I want to get Mommy the help she needs.

After packing my bag as usual, I turn back to Mommy.
Kaito
I'm going now.
Mom
Take care out there, sweetie.
Mom
Do your best.
Kaito
I will.

I walk to the elevator at the center of the low side.

My pace picks up almost to a run without me even realizing I'm doing it.

It's strange.

It's the same road I walk to work every day, but my steps feel so light today.

I'm nervous, but...

I'm looking forward to seeing Yonagi by the elevator. I can't wait!
Yonagi
Ah.

When I arrive at the elevator, Yonagi's already there waiting for me.

Noticing me, she smiles and waves.
Yonagi
Kaito!
Kaito
Good morning.
Yonagi
You came!
Kaito
Y-Yeah.

I find myself fidgeting with the strap of my bag for some reason.

I notice that Yonagi has something strange in her hand.

It looks square, angular, and looks to be made of a hard material.
Kaito
What's that?
Yonagi
I've got something I'd like to ask you.
Kaito
Mm?
Yonagi
Can I take a photo of you?
Kaito
A photo? You mean like... a photograph? With one of those machines that record still images?
Yonagi
Yeah! This one prints the picture as soon as it takes it. Nifty, huh?
Yonagi
It's really old!
Kaito
Whoa.
Yonagi
So, can I take a picture of you?
Kaito
Uh, why?
Yonagi
Because I wanna take one!
Kaito
But why?
Yonagi
Come on! Don't be like that! Face this way! I wanna see a big smile!

Yonagi says as she points the camera at me.
Kaito
Uhh...
Yonagi
Come on, I can only take so many pictures! You gotta make it count!
Kaito
R-Really?!

My eyes widen in surprise, and the device Yonagi's carrying makes a clicking sound.
Yonagi
Ahahah, funny face!
Kaito
Why can you only take a few photos?
Yonagi
Because I don't have more of this paper. See?

The little black box spits out a piece of white paper from a slit at the bottom. Yonagi takes it and starts flapping it around.

A faint image of me starts to appear on it.

Little by little, it gains color as she flaps it around.
Kaito
That's amazing!
Yonagi
After I finish using what I have right now, there'll be no more paper left.
Yonagi
It was from my dad.
Kaito
How many sheets do you have left?
Yonagi
That's a secret!
Kaito
...

If she's taking pictures of me, she must have a whole lot of them left.

I mean, it's just me.
Yonagi
Okay, good. I'm glad you let me take a picture of you.

Yonagi carefully puts the photo away, like it's a precious treasure.
Yonagi
Let's go.
Kaito
O-Okay.

We ride the elevator then walk together through the middle side.

Normally, I'd be working by now.

I can see some lowsiders cleaning the roads, actually.

I walk with Yonagi until we come upon a big, symmetrical building.
Kaito
This is school?
Yonagi
You've never been here?
Kaito
No... I always worked.
Yonagi
Then that makes you my junior! Here's where the school and the research institute are.
Kaito
So the researchers work here?

I look up at the big building.
Yonagi
This side is the school, and the other one is the research institute. We can't go into the institute, by the way.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
Let's go to the classroom first.
Kaito
Classroom?
Yonagi
We all get together in the mornings there. We lowsider kids are free after that, so we can go to the library.
Kaito
Really?
Yonagi
Yeah. Only the midsider and topsider kids have fixed classes. Poor things.
Yonagi
I think people should be allowed to study whatever they wanna study.
Kaito
Yeah, I think the same.

Yonagi's eyes widen at my answer, then she smiles and nods.
Yonagi
Let's go.

I follow Yonagi to the classroom.

The room is larger than I expected.
Yonagi
Let's sit down.
Kaito
Mhm.
Yonagi
Lowsiders sit by the back.
Kaito
Ah, so we're kept apart here too?
Yonagi
Yeah, the topsiders sit at the front, then the midsiders, and then us.

We sit side by side along the back wall of the classroom.

Students enter the classroom one after the other.

Some are smaller than us, and some are bigger.

The seats gradually fill up.

The seats for us lowsiders are all occupied, so the other lowsider kids begin standing at the back instead.

There are still a lot of empty seats in the topsider and midsider rows.

I see Shachi enter the classroom.

Shachi and Izumo go to one of the topsider seats, and the others who came along with him go the midsider seats.

Most of the topsiders like Shachi have androids with them.

I hear a ringing sound I'm not familiar with. In the end, the empty topsider seats remain empty.

Professor Asuma enters the classroom shortly after.
Yonagi
The first thirty minutes are Professor Asuma's history lesson.
Kaito
History?

All the topsider and midsider kids have the same images displayed on their terminals.
Kaito
What's that?
Yonagi
Textbooks.
Kaito
What are they for?
Yonagi
They have what the teacher is talking about written down in them.
Kaito
I don't have one of those.
Yonagi
You can always read it in the library.
Kaito
Oh, okay.

Looking around, I notice that none of the lowsider kids have terminals.

The one I have back home is something I picked up from the dump.

The lowsider students probably aren't given their own terminals.
Asuma
Last week I explained the discovery of paraglucose and its glycolysis pathway. Today, I will talk about the impact they had.
Asuma
Paraglucose is an artificial sweetener that was invented in 2075. Its chemical formula is very similar to those of glucose.
Asuma
This artificial sweetener is synthesized from the monosaccharides found in ancient microbes that were discovered frozen in the permafrost of Antarctica.
Asuma
At the time, this artificial sweetener was groundbreaking in two ways.
Asuma
One reason was that this component could serve as an energy source for the brain. Until then, artificial sweeteners affected the brain in no discernible way.
Asuma
Until that time, glucose was the sole known source of energy for the brain. Since the brain is an organism that functions constantly, our bodies need to keep breaking down food for glucose to send to the brain.
Asuma
Just like our heart, our brain doesn't stop working, even while we sleep. Whether we're conscious or unconscious, it's always working.
Asuma
Even the hunger we feel is an unconscious command from our brain that influences us.
Asuma
We obey these commands from our brain, and eat to provide it with nourishment.
Shachi
Like a lowsider.

Laughter bubbles up from the front rows.

But Professor Asuma doesn't look amused.
Asuma
Thousands of years ago, humankind didn't always have stable access to sustenance. The history of humankind is also the history of its fight against hunger.
Asuma
That's why our bodies have multiple layers of mechanisms to store glucose. That's the way our bodies evolved.
Asuma
On the other hand, when we there's an excess of glucose and the blood sugar level rises too much, the only way to suppress it is for the body to produce insulin.
Asuma
When this natural safety check fails, a person suffers from a disease called diabetes. When humanity was still above the ground, the prevalence of diabetes in developed countries was an ever-rising concern.
Asuma
Even after developing agriculture and establishing a stable supply of food, the habit of impulsively eating whatever is in front of you never disappeared.
Asuma
The evolution of a species is basically irreversible. Once a change develops, there's no way to roll it back.
Asuma
That's why people had to learn to restrain themselves. To stay healthy, of course, but that wasn't the only incentive.

The professor looks over the classroom.
Asuma
It was because the humans of the surface deemed obesity to be unappealing.
Asuma
To have the self control not to overeat despite having a near inexhaustible source of food at your fingertips was perhaps valued as a symbol of spiritual virtue.
Asuma
On one hand, there was the brain and its ancestral impulse to try and secure a stable intake of glucose, and on the other, the collective aesthetic sense of humanity that dictated what body shapes were appealing.
Asuma
There was constant conflict between these two sides.
Asuma
Sounds like a war between humankind and their brains, doesn't it?
Asuma
In the end, though, mankind won the war. After the discovery and subsequent mass production of paraglucose, that is.
Asuma
That said, that too was an achievement born from the ingenuity of the human brain. You could say the brain simply got tired of arguing with us.

There's laughter in the classroom.
Asuma
Now, moving on to the discovery of paraglucose and this new process of glycolysis. What made it so revolutionary was its ability to nourish the brain, and only the brain.
Asuma
This new glycolysis process only occurred within the brain.
Asuma
Inside the brain, paraglucose became a biological energy source called ATP, which supplied energy directly to the synapses.
Asuma
Paraglucose supplied the brain with energy, but in the rest of the bloodstream, it was simply expelled as waste.
Asuma
It was tested on any number of animals, and in no case was it found to accumulate in the body.
Asuma
Only the brain can make use of it, so the rest of the body just expels it.
Asuma
Its properties were simply staggering. No matter how much of it you had, you wouldn't get fat, there was no risk of diabetes, and the brain was supplied with more than enough energy.
Asuma
But this was not the only reason the paraglucose exploded in popularity. Why else do you think that was?

Asuma scans the room for a moment.
Asuma
Its taste.
Asuma
Paraglucose simply tasted good, and that's what really sealed the deal.

There are some giggles and murmuring in the classroom.
Asuma
Other artificial sweeteners up to that point would be, say, for example, 5000 times sweeter than sugar.
Asuma
The artificial ones might seem to have an overwhelming advantage in terms of sweetness. But there was something odd about their taste.
Asuma
It's said that most people could distinguish between normal sugar and artificial sweeteners.
Asuma
But no one could tell the difference between sugar and paraglucose.
Asuma
Paraglucose was the only one that deceived the human tongue, and as such it was adopted almost immediately.
Asuma
It spread all over the world so fast that soon, there wasn't a person out there who hadn't tasted it.
Asuma
But what no one realized was that paraglucose was a mutagenic agent. In other words...
Asuma
No one realized how it was mutating the genes within human germ cells.
Asuma
By the time these effects were noticed, mankind had been consuming paraglucose for around two generations.
Asuma
Humanity was evolving without anyone being the wiser.
Asuma
Let's wrap things up here for today. I'll explain the details of what came after in the next lesson.

The professor closes the machine that was projecting images onto the board behind him and leaves the classroom.
Kaito
Paraglucose...
Yonagi
We only get lessons with him once a week. You sure are lucky. That was fun, wasn't it?

I nod.
Yonagi
Okay, we're free now! What do you wanna do?
Kaito
Oh, there's no more?
Yonagi
Nope. They say there aren't enough classrooms or teachers. But if you go to the library, you can watch videos of old classes.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
I'll show you around since it's your first day. Then let's go to the library and read books together.
Kaito
Yeah, thanks.
Yonagi
We can go the workshop, then the roof, and then the library. Let's go!
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
This is the workshop!
Kaito
Oh, I see.

I drink in the sight of each of the workshops as we walk around.

There are so many tools and machines that I've never seen before.

My interest is especially piqued by one of them.
Kaito
What's this?
Yonagi
Hm, good question.

It's a hollow, square box.

There are a bunch of round things lined up around it.

Its shape reminds me of the cars I saw on the monitor.
Kaito
Maybe it was made here, with these tools?
Yonagi
Maybe. Now, let's get going.
Kaito
W-Wait! Not yet!
Yonagi
But we've gotta take a look at the rooftop, read in the library, and then go to work!
Yonagi
We're gonna run out of time!
????
That's a printer.

I look back and see Professor Asuma standing behind me.
Yonagi
Oh, hello, Professor.
Asuma
I don't often see you in here, Yonagi.
Yonagi
I'm showing my friend around.

Professor Asuma smiles fondly at Yonagi.
Kaito
U-Um, Professor?
Kaito
Y-You said it's a printer?
Asuma
Press that button there, would you?
Kaito
This?

I press the button he's pointing to.

There's a strange noise, and the screen on the side of the hollow box lights up.
Asuma
This device holds scan data of the main manufactured goods that we humans had in the surface era, so that we can recreate the lives we had up there.
Asuma
It can make whatever you need. You just need to input the right data, scale, and color.
Kaito
And what about those things around it?
Asuma
These items have been printed using that data.
Kaito
Amazing!
Asuma
Would you like to try making something?

I nod sheepishly.

Professor Asuma smiles at me, then does something with the machine.

The next moment, a semi-transparent image appears inside the box.
Asuma
Is this what you wanted?
Kaito
Ah...

It's a car.

A roundish base for a car.

It's what I wanted to make, but..
Kaito
Um, the shape is a little more like this...

I trace the shape I envisioned with my finger.
Asuma
I see.
Asuma
Like this?
Kaito
Yes!

Now the display shows the same shape as the car I saw on the middle side monitor before.

In the video, there was a happy family riding in it.
Kaito
That's it! Yes...
Asuma
What color would you like?
Kaito
Um, yellow. A kind of dark yellow, if you can...
Asuma
You can turn the little knob here to change the color. Go ahead and try.
Kaito
O-Okay.

I turn the knob and make it the same color as I saw on the monitor.
Asuma
How about the size?
Kaito
U-Um, I want to put it on this...

I rummage inside my bag and take out the base of the car.
Asuma
Oh.

His eyes sparkle when I show him the little car atop the palm of my hand.
Asuma
You repaired it. Mind if I take a look?

I nod and hand it to him.
Asuma
Amazing. You even found the right parts for it. You didn't make any of these parts, did you?

I shake my head.
Kaito
I picked them up in the dump...

I remember what Yonagi said yesterday.
Kaito
I took the parts out of a music box.
Asuma
Oh, a music box, huh? I see…
Asuma
Can I turn it on?
Kaito
Yeah.
Asuma
Hahah! Incredible! It's really well done.
Asuma
Now we need to give it a good chassis.

The professor takes a ruler out of a white cabinet and carefully measures the small car.
Asuma
Okay, I know what size we need now.
Asuma
Here you go. Thanks for showing me.

After handing the car back to me, the professor inputs some numbers into the machine.
Asuma
Don't look away now. This is the fun part.

He takes a step back so that the machine is in full view for both me and Yonagi.

White lights come out from the back and the right-hand side, and little by little, the body of the car materializes.
Kaito
Whoa! Amazing!

In no time at all, the body of the car is right there, behind the clear screen.
Asuma
When this meter is empty, it'll be ready. It's cooling off right now.
Kaito
Cooling… It's hot in there?
Asuma
Very hot.
Asuma
It's ready now. Open it up.
Kaito
...

When I pull on the handle he points me to, the transparent screen opens.
Kaito
Whoa, it's amazing!
Asuma
Your car's complete now. It's an SUV.
Kaito
SUV?
Asuma
It stands for Sports Utility Vehicle. See how it has space at the back to load up baggage?
Asuma
Back when people lived above ground, they use to move their bodies by using different tools.  This entertainment was called sports, and so they called this a Sports Utility Vehicle.
Kaito
Can I put it on the car?
Asuma
Of course.

I take some putty out of my bag.
Asuma
Hmm, is that putty? The kind that's used to repair the water pipes?

I nod.
Asuma
You can use this one. It's putty for handicrafts.
Asuma
There are various types of putty you can use depending on the task you want to accomplish. You can have this to keep.
Kaito
Th-Thanks...
Yonagi
Must be nice. Hmph!
Asuma
You want some too, Yonagi?
Yonagi
Ah, no, I'm fine. I wouldn't use it for anything.

The professor chuckles at Yonagi's comment and then turns to me.
Asuma
The switch is inside, right? You should make it so that the chassis is removable.
Kaito
I see. Okay, so...
Asuma
See these hooked parts on the inside of the chassis? Try to make it so that they hook onto the frame.
Kaito
Okay...

I fix the SUV frame onto the car with putty.
Kaito
It's done!

I look up. The professor is smiling down at me.
Asuma
That's great.
Kaito
Th-Thank you!
Asuma
No, I didn't do a thing. This is your work.

I turn to Yonagi.
Kaito
It's done! Check it out, Yonagi!
Yonagi
Yeah! It looks great!
Kaito
Let's make it run!
Yonagi
Huh? What about the library?
Kaito
We can go after!

I start running, hugging my bag to my chest.
Yonagi
We won't have time! Kaito!
Yonagi
Wait, you forgot your music box!
Yonagi
Geez!
Asuma
Hahah, he's a good boy. I can see him becoming a researcher.
Yonagi
Right?
Kaito
Yonagi, this way! The rooftop is here, right?
Yonagi
Yeah, but wait for me!
Kaito
Look!
Kaito
This is it! It's just like I saw it in the video!
Yonagi
You seem super happy.
Kaito
I'm very happy!
Yonagi
It's kind of contagious, heheh.
Yonagi
Good thing you came to school, right?
Kaito
Yeah!

I chase the SUV as it runs along the floor.

I'll show it to Mommy.

I worked so hard because I didn't want to show her something unfinished.

And finally...
Shachi
Nnh...
Kaito
Ah!

My little car hits Shachi's shoe and comes to a stop.
Shachi
What are YOU doing here?
Shachi
Shouldn't you be working?
Kaito
...

I hear Yonagi come running up behind me.
Shachi
What's this? A car?
Kaito
That's... my...
Yonagi
Give it back. Kaito made that.

I look fearfully up at Shachi.

But I'm surprised to see that his attention is not on me.

Instead, he's staring at what Yonagi has in her hands.
Shachi
Why do you have that?
Yonagi
Huh?
Shachi
That's a music box, right? That was in my house! Show it to me!
Yonagi
...

I look back over my shoulder and meet Yonagi's gaze.

I can see the unease in her eyes.
Kaito
I found it in the garbage dump, so—
Shachi
Dirty liar! No one threw that way! Give it to me!
Kaito
It was in the garbage! It was broken!
Yonagi
Ah...

Shachi snatches the box from Yonagi's hands.

Then he opens the lid and looks inside.
Shachi
You broke it didn't you? What did you do to it?
Kaito
It was already broken, so I took some parts, but I—
Shachi
You broke it! You're the one who did this!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
...

Suddenly, memories of Shachi coming back from school covered in grass come to me.

Maybe that's what he was looking for.
Shachi
How dare you break my things? You dirty lowsider.
Shachi
You piece of trash!

Shachi shouts as he grabs my car and raises it above his head.
Kaito
Sto—
Kaito
...

He slams it down on the hard floor before I can even say anything.

I simply stand there, stunned.

I feel the tears begin to swell in my eyes.

Within seconds, they fall down my face and make a puddle on the floor.

One after the other.

The pool of tears keeps getting bigger and bigger.
Yonagi
Kaito...

Crouching down, I frantically try to gather all the broken pieces.
Shachi
I'll make you regret this.

With that, Shachi leaves.

An unfamiliar set of legs appears in my field of vision.
Izumo
Here.

Izumo places another piece of the broken car in front of me.
Kaito
...

I put down my bag.

Then I pull out the putty from inside.

I wipe my tears away.

But more come.
Yonagi
What are you doing? You're fixing it?

I silently nod.

I try to stick the frame together with the putty Professor Asuma gave me.

But they won't stay together.

I try using the putty I was originally using too.

The frame starts getting uglier and uglier.

I cover the motor and power source with putty as well.

But when I flip the switch, nothing happens.

I rub the tears from my eyes again and peel off the putty.

When I take a spare motor out of my bag and try to install it, the gear I had attached to the last one splits apart.

Just that light pressure was enough to break it in two.

I grit my teeth.

The gear is one of the most important parts: it's the part that transmits the rotation of the motor.

Wiping my tears yet again, I set myself to fixing the gear first.

I put some putty on the gear where it broke. But now it's the wrong size.
Yonagi
Kaito... It's almost time for work. We need to go.
Kaito
You can go.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
I'll come after I fix it...
Yonagi
But...

I keep working on the car, tears streaming down my face.
Yonagi
I'll wait with you.
Kaito
...
Kaito
*Sob* Ngh...

I don't even know what I'm trying to do anymore.

I've spent so long trying to put the car back together.

I figured some things out.

The gears need to be strong, because there's a lot of pressure on them.

Once one breaks, you need to replace it with a new one.

Which means...

I can't fix it right now.
Kaito
Ngh... *Sob*

I learned that when you cry for too long, your throat and head start to hurt.

That no matter how much you try to hold back tears, they'll just keep coming.

That once you start crying, it's hard to stop.
Yonagi
Kaito...
Kaito
*Sob* Ugh...
Yonagi
Let's go. We've gotta go home.
Yonagi
Your mom must be worried.
Kaito
...I wanted to show her.
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
She can't go see the... *Sob*... middle side monitor, so I...
Yonagi
Yes...
Kaito
I-I thought... *Sob*... that the car on the monitor looked so cool…
Kaito
I wanted to show it to her... So I made one…
Kaito
I made it... I-It worked, and...
Yonagi
...Mhm.
Kaito
But now…
Kaito
I can't even fix it now... *Sob*

I stand up and wipe my tears.

My sleeves are soaked.

Yonagi stands next to me and looks at the broken car by my feet.

It looks okay, but it doesn't work now.

It's just an empty shell that can't move anymore.
Yonagi
...It won't run anymore?

I slowly shake my head.

Yonagi silently picks the car up.

Then she takes my hand gently with her free hand.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Let's go. Can you walk?

I nod.
Yonagi
Okay.
Yonagi
Your house is this way?
Kaito
Yeah...

She keeps holding my hand the whole way.

I walk a little behind her, trying my best to wipe the tears away.
Yonagi
Corn sure grows big, huh?
Kaito
...Mhm.

Her hand felt cold at first, but now it's warm.

Her soft hand is wrapped firmly around my own.
Yonagi
Wanna know what I think?
Kaito
Mm?
Yonagi
I'm sure you'll make something even more amazing someday.
Kaito
More amazing?
Yonagi
Yes. Something that will make people smile!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
I know you can make it!
Kaito
I don't know about that...
Yonagi
We can ask Professor Asuma to let you use the workshop from now on. You'll have everything you need!
Yonagi
No one will ever accuse you of doing anything bad ever again.
Kaito
Okay...
Yonagi
So don't cry anymore.

Yonagi's voice falters.

It stops me in my tracks.

Her tone is filled with worry.

I upset her too.

I don't even know what I'm feeling anymore.

The memory of Shachi smashing the car down flashes through my head again.

The way he glared at me, his eyes full of scorn.

Why is it so clear in my mind? How can I recall it so vividly?

When all I want to do is forget...

The more I think about it, the clearer I see that image of the moment the car broke. All those bad emotions keep filling my chest, making me dizzy.
Yonagi
Kaito.

I sense Yonagi approach as I hang my head, trying to stifle my sad sobs.

I can see her toes as I look down at the ground.

She stands on her tiptoes, like she's stretching upward.

And then, I feel something soft touch my forehead.
Kaito
Huh?

The feeling is followed by a gentle warmth.

The same one I felt as we held hands.

Her scent envelops me.

A soft, gentle scent that's a little different from Mommy's.

I feel the sensation of her lips on my forehead.

It melts away the cover of sadness shrouding my heart, replacing it with a calm that fills me completely.

And then, all I feel is her.
Yonagi
...
Yonagi
You stopped crying.
Kaito
M-Mhm...

As she pulls back from the kiss, I notice she's blushing a little.

I probably am as well.

My face feels hot.

She smiles at me, cheeks still tinged with pink,
Yonagi
I'm so glad you stopped crying.
Kaito
Yeah...
Yonagi
We can go to the workshop and make another one.
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
But we have to take turns going to the library and the workshop, okay?
Yonagi
Next time it'll be my turn to show you what I'm making.

I raise my face to look at her.
Kaito
What you're making?
Kaito
What are you making?
Yonagi
Heheh.
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
You wanna know?

I nod.
Yonagi
A story!
Kaito
What?
Yonagi
I'm making my own story!
Yonagi
I'll show it to you tomorrow.
Kaito
Okay...
Yonagi
Are you excited for it?
Kaito
...

Oh, so you can make your own stories. I never thought of that.
Yonagi
Are yooouuu?
Kaito
...Yeah.
Yonagi
Great!
Yonagi
Ah, is that your house?
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
Can I come with you?
Kaito
...

I give her a small nod.
Kaito
Hi, Mommy.
Mom
Welcome ba—Huh?
Yonagi
Good day!
Mom
Good... day?
Yonagi
My name is Yonagi.
Mom
Ooh!

My mom exclaims in delight, to Yonagi's joyful surprise.
Mom
So you're the Yonagi I've heard so much about.
Yonagi
Yes! Good day! Err, evening!
Mom
Good evening.
Yonagi
Can I come in?
Mom
Of course! I've been looking forward to meeting you!

Yonagi turns to me in surprise.
Mom
Yep.
Yonagi
Mm?
Mom
You're as cute as a button. Just like Kaito said!

My head snaps up to look at Mommy.

Yonagi glances at me, a satisfied smile spreading across her face.
Kaito
I never said that!
Mom
Oh, you didn't?
Kaito
No!
Mom
I could tell you were thinking it, though.
Kaito
D-D-Don't lie!
Yonagi
Ahahah!

Yonagi and Mommy laugh together.
Mom
You said you wouldn't mind being her friend.
Yonagi
Really?!
Kaito
Well...
Kaito
I guess I did say that...
Yonagi
Eheheh.
Mom
You're all he talks about these days.
Yonagi
Huh? Really?!
Kaito
Mommy!
Kaito
That's not true...
Mom
Like the tortilla incident.
Yonagi
Ahahah, right! When it got all stuck to his face.
Kaito
You spat it on my face! Your cheeks were this big!
Yonagi
Ahahah!
Mom
You can speak other languages, Yonagi?
Yonagi
Huh?
Mom
Oh, Kaito, what was it? The mascara thing?
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
Mascara de Tortilla?
Yonagi
That's Spanish!
Mom
Spanish? Hmm...
Yonagi
It's a language from a country called Spain. I can't speak it, though. I just read a book called La Mascara de Zorro.
Mom
Wow!
Yonagi
Wait, was it La Mascara DEL Zorro? I kind of forgot.
Yonagi
But that's where it comes from! Tortillas are like, the national dish of Mexico, right?
Yonagi
And since they spoke Spanish in Mexico, Kaito became Mascara de Tortilla!
Kaito
That makes no sense!
Mom
You know all kinds of things, huh?
Yonagi
I love books! And stories!
Mom
Hmm!
Kaito
...

I stare at the car Yonagi's still holding.
Yonagi
...

Yonagi notices and offers it to me.
Mom
Mm?
Yonagi
Kaito.

I take the car from her and stare down at it.
Mom
Is that the car you made?
Kaito
...
Mom
Can I see it now?
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Um, Kaito's Mom... You know? The car he made was working, but it got broken.
Mom
Oh...

Mommy quietly looks down at me for a minute.

I keep looking down to avoid meeting her gaze.

And then...

I feel my eyes tearing up again.

The car was finally right here in my hands, yet I've already lost it.
Kaito
Mommy, I...
Kaito
Someone broke it before I could show it to you.
Kaito
...
Mom
Someone broke it?
Kaito
...

The tears roll down my face.

I just stare down as they fall by my feet.
Mom
I see now.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Um...
Mom
Yes?
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
Do you, um, think you could... keep a secret?
Mom
...

I raise my face.

Yonagi's staring at me, her expression serious.

Next, I turn my teary eyes to meet Mommy's.

She looks a little puzzled.

I probably have the same look on my face.

But we both nod.
Mom
Yes, I can.
Kaito
Me too.
Yonagi
Then give me your hands.

We present our hands to her.

Yonagi takes hold of my left hand and Mommy's right hand.
Yonagi
You two hold hands too.

I hold the hand that Mommy can't move.

Now we're making a small ring.
Yonagi
Close your eyes.

After exchanging a glance with Mommy, we both close our eyes.
Yonagi
Okay, here goes. Don't get spooked, okay?

Her gentle voice sinks into me, permeating my body, and then...
Kaito
Huh?

The car is running.

It's gliding across the smooth rooftop floor.

It's just like what I saw earlier.

But the angle is different.

The outlines of the vision sharpen, becoming clearer around the car.

I'm there too.

I'm smiling.

I'm happily skipping away, chasing the car.
Kaito
This is it! It's just like I saw it in the video!
Yonagi
You seem super happy.

I'm talking in the vision now.

I also hear Yonagi's voice.
Kaito
I'm very happy!
Yonagi
It's kind of contagious, heheh.
Yonagi
Good thing you came to school, right?
Kaito
Yeah!

I keep chasing the car.

And then, it ends.
Yonagi
...
Mom
...
Kaito
What...

When I open my eyes again, I'm back home.

Mommy's eyes are as big as plates.

It was like we were right there on the rooftop.
Kaito
What was that?
Yonagi
It's kind of like a memory of what I saw today, maybe.
Mom
...
Kaito
...

Mommy and I are lost for words.

We've never experienced anything like it before.

We remain frozen in place, slack-jawed.
Yonagi
Um...
Yonagi
One day I just realized I could do it. But I was told not to, because it would scare people…
Kaito
Who told you that?
Yonagi
My dad.
Kaito
...

The one that passed away.

She said that he's the one who named her.
Yonagi
That's why I want to keep it a secret.

Clearly nervous, she starts fidgeting with her fingers.
Kaito
...That was amazing.
Mom
It was!

Yonagi raises her face and looks at us.
Kaito
It's incredible! How do you do it?! How does it work?!
Yonagi
Uh, h-how it works? I don't really know myself.
Mom
It wasn't scary at all! You have a wonderful power!
Yonagi
Huh?
Mom
Thank you, Yonagi.
Mom
You helped me see my boy out there enjoying himself. I want you to know that it made me really happy!
Kaito
I wanted you to see the car, not m—

I don't finish my sentence.

I can see tears shining in Mommy's eyes.
Mom
It made me so very happy. Thank you so much.

Mom uses her good hand to clasp Yonagi's tightly.

Yonagi is taken aback for a moment, her face flushing.

Tears well up in her eyes too.

She's probably crying for the same kind of reason Mommy is.

Yonagi keeps bobbing her head at her.
Yonagi
Eheheh.

Then she wipes her tears and looks back at us with a bright smile on her face.
Yonagi
I'm glad you liked it! You're welcome!

Time goes by in a flash as we keep talking, and before I know it, it's already dark outside.
Mom
Yonagi, shouldn't you be getting home soon?
Yonagi
Don't worry! I live close!
Kaito
Hey, wanna have dinner here?
Yonagi
Huh? Are you sure?
Kaito
Yeah, we've got—

And that's when I realize.
Kaito
Aaaah!
Yonagi
Uh, wh-what's wrong?!
Mom
Kaito?
Kaito
The rations...

I murmur, turning back to Yonagi.
Kaito
We didn't get them...
Kaito
We didn't go to work either.
Yonagi
Because you spent the whole afternoon fixing the car!
Kaito
What do we do now?
Yonagi
What do you have? Let's make something.
Yonagi
Momm—Ah, Kaito's Mom, can I use the kitchen?
Mom
Of course! Kaito's the one who always cooks, and I would love it if he had some help.
Yonagi
Yeah!
Yonagi
What do you have?
Kaito
Um, corn flour, and, uhh...
Yonagi
What can we do with this?
Kaito
Hmm, we have beans and cheese. That's pretty much it.
Yonagi
Wanna make tacos?
Kaito
Tacos?
Yonagi
What? You don't know tacos?!
Kaito
I don't think we get those in the rations.
Yonagi
Okay! Kaito, you make the tortillas. I'll make the filling with the beans. You have seasoning, right?
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
Chop chop! I'm hungry, so let's get to it!
Kaito
I-I know.
Mom
Heheh.

After eating Yonagi's homemade tacos, we clean up, and she gets ready to leave.
Yonagi
Thank you for having me.
Mom
You'll have to come by again soon!
Yonagi
Yeah, I will!
Mom
Next time, I'll read you a picture book as thanks for today!
Yonagi
Really?! The one about Kaito?

Mommy looks surprised upon hearing this.
Kaito
Yonagi likes that one too.
Mom
I see!

She smiles at me and turns back to Yonagi.
Mom
Sure, I'll read that one for you!
Yonagi
Yay! When can I come?
Mom
Whenever! I'm always here.
Yonagi
Tomorrow?!
Mom
Yes, feel free to drop by!
Yonagi
Yes!

Mom smiles as she sees how happy Yonagi is.
Yonagi
See you tomorrow then!
Mom
See you.
Yonagi
You too, Kaito!
Kaito
You say bye to me last? Hmph...

I accompany her out of the house.
Kaito
Are you sure you're okay by yourself?
Yonagi
Yeah, it's fine! The moon is bright tonight.
Kaito
Thanks for today.
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
I'm really happy you were with me. Thank you...
Yonagi
It's fine! That's what friends are for!

Her bubbly, confident tone is back.
Kaito
And sorry.
Yonagi
For what?

She stares at me curiously.
Kaito
For making you skip work.
Yonagi
Oh, it's fine! Let's go apologize before going to school tomorrow.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
Let's meet in the middle square tomorrow before school, okay?
Kaito
Yeah, thanks.
Yonagi
But tomorrow we go to the library, not the workshop, okay?

She makes me smile.
Kaito
Yeah, I wanna read books too.
Yonagi
Hey, Kaito.
Kaito
Yeah?
Yonagi
I was right. Your mom's really cool!
Kaito
Yeah.

I nod decisively.
Kaito
She's amazing, right?
Yonagi
Kaito, do you think I could maybe...

Yonagi looks down and fidgets with her hands again.
Yonagi
...Would you be mad if I called her Mommy too?
Kaito
...

She looks up at me for a second, then casts her gaze back down.

I smile and shake my head.
Kaito
I wouldn't mind if it's you.

Yonagi looks up at me, her eyes full of expectation.
Kaito
I think she would like it too.

When she hears that, her mouth widens into a full smile.
Yonagi
Then... tell her for me! Tell her I'll be here tomorrow!
Kaito
Okay.

Yonagi waves goodbye as she enters the cornfield.

I watch her run off between the tall corn stalks until she's out of sight.
