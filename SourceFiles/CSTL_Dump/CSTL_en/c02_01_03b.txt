I walk through the darkened city on my way to the pub.

The same streets I tottered my way through while chasing Olivia.

A phantom pain from the restraints still remains in my wrists.

I look up at the sky while I walk.

There's a full moon tonight.
Will
...

The view of Olivia's profile comes to mind.

The memory of those fair cheeks and her shining eyes is burned into my mind.

And the force of her slaps are still burning my cheeks.

Did she really need to hit me so damn much?

She might be beautiful, but she's a violent and arrogant woman.

But she did save my life.

Were it not for her, I would have no head right about now.

Did she really take me as a slave just so I could write plays for her?

I can't even believe this night was real.

Too many things happened, and I'm still reeling from all of it.

But...
Olivia
The words you write are brimming with life.
Olivia
Make me shiver in excitement, understood?

I've never had someone read my words with such passion, or had anyone expect anything from me.

Olivia's the first.

I clasp the parchment in my hands.

It's deeply scarred with different wrinkles from the ones it had when I set out to the Spencer estate.
