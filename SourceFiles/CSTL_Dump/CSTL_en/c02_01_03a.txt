After staying up all night two days in a row, I manage to get the script in a presentable shape by the second morning.

I notice Dad hasn't touched his meal today either.

I go up to my room in the afternoon to catch some shut-eye before work.

Rob shows up to pick up the script just before it's time to open the pub, a little before sundown.

I'm not completely happy with it, but it's good enough for the time I was given.
Rob
Thanks, lad! You're my savior!
Will
To be honest, there are a few parts that are still a bit rough. I don't mind if they feel like touching things up during rehearsal.
Rob
No matter, lad. Mind if I give you the rest of the money when I get it from Spencer?
Will
Sure. Thanks.
Rob
Huh? Where's the Boss?
Will
Still in bed. He should be getting up soon.
Rob
Still not eating?
Will
Doesn't seem like it. He hasn't eaten a thing today.
Rob
That's worrying.
Will
He doesn't listen to me.
Will
Lately, I think he's trying to act like everything's all right for my sake.
Rob
The man can put up a brave front even while blind, eh? That's some resilience.
Will
...

It's been four years since his eyesight started worsening significantly.
Rob
You got confidence in this thing?

Rob asks, lightly tapping the script.
Will
It's competent. The fairy character is well done, I think.
Will
It's a good role, so I bet it could be popular if the actor nails the part.
Rob
That's what I like to hear. Thanks, my lad.

After a while, my father slowly comes down the stairs.
Will
Rise and shine. Rob's here, Dad.
Father
Oh, that you, Rob? Skipping out on work again?
Rob
The first thing you do is slander me?! I'm turning your son's scripts into money so this place doesn't go out of business!
Father
Want a drink? I bet you do. Come and get some ale in you.
Rob
I can't get drunk until I turn in this script!
Father
Aw, don't be coy.

Feeling as he goes with his white cane, Dad heads for his usual seat at the end of the counter.
Father
Son, how about pouring your father some ale to wet his whistle?
Will
You know what the answer is.

He flashes an amused grin in my general direction.

To be honest, he doesn't look well enough to drink.

He's just overcompensating with banter.

I put out the 'open' sign after Rob leaves.

Though it's not like there's a huge line of people waiting to enter.
Father
*Cough*

Dad coughs a little, and it sounds bad enough for me to raise an eyebrow.
Will
Are you sure you're feeling well?
Father
Yeah, same old.
Will
Wanna eat something? I'll cook.
Father
It's fine. The jerky from yesterday was enough.
Will
But you'll feel better if you eat something.
Will
Is there anything in particular you want? We're good for this month, so I can go buy something.
Father
Wait until the end of the month. You still have to get paid, right?
Will
Yeah, but...
Father
Don't you worry. I don't move about a lot, so I don't need as much food.
Will
...
Father
You've been working yourself to the bone these days. You should rest a bit. You gotta take care of yourself.
Will
That's rich coming from you.
Father
Hahah, touche.
Will
I'll close up shop early tonight then head to bed.
Father
Good.

At night, Ed shows up after work.

He nurses his cup of ale and treats me to one as well.
Ed
I see Rob's not here.
Will
Yeah. I wanted to ask if the script was well received.
Ed
It'll be fine. Your work speaks of human nature itself.
Ed
The people want to see real stories about the struggles we all face.
Will
If that's the case, I have Rob to thank for feeding me rumors, and you for always asking the poignant questions.
Ed
The rumors he definitely heard from people in countries he hasn't even been to, you mean?

I laugh in response.

Ed echoes it with his own laughter.
Ed
You think he really hears them from other people?
Will
If he comes up with all those stories on his own, he's a bloody genius.
Ed
You're the one actually writing them down, though. And no one but you would have the memory to recall so much from years past.
Will
Hmm... You think so?

He nods firmly.
Ed
You have talent. I've become able to spot such things after working at the Lily Theater for so long.
Will
...
Ed
I've listened to what I've been assured are the best plays Tenbridge has to offer while preparing scones to sell to those in attendance.

He pauses for a moment then directs a broad smile at me.
Ed
And I don't think your work has anything to envy in comparison.

Since he's a priest, Ed has to do a lot of odd jobs while in hiding.

From what I gather, the theater he works at is always at capacity.

And the playwright writing those scripts must be...
Will
Christopher Marlowe, yeah?
Ed
Yes.
Will
Isn't it dangerous to work at the theater? You've been there for a long while now.
Will
And there are always so many people around.
Ed
No better place to hide a tree than the forest.
Will
I suppose... But some people might start getting suspicious. It's best to err on the side of caution.
Ed
Thanks for the concern.

Ed smiles and nods.

Just as it's a crime to shelter Catholics, there is a reward for denouncing them to the authorities.

In a sense, the whole city is his enemy.

Many people will jump at shadows for the chance of getting rewarded, so it's important to not raise any kind of suspicion.
Ed
By the way, what's the title?
Will
Of the play, you mean?

Ed nods.
Will
A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Will
A story of the events of one night disappearing like a dream.
Will
It's a satirical comedy that I hope can touch people's hearts.
Ed
A Midsummer Night's Dream, huh? It has a nice ring to it.

Ed murmurs, taking a swig of his ale.

I do the same.

...

I feel like something's not quite right here.

Dad's not heckling.

I turn my gaze to his seat at the end of the bar.

He's slumped face down across the counter.
Will
Uh, sorry, give me a minute.

Realizing the situation, Ed smiles and nods.
Will
Dad, go upstairs if you wanna sleep.

But when I put my hand on his shoulder to rouse him, I realize something's wrong.

He's shivering.
Will
Dad?
Father
S-So cold... My head...
Will
Are you in pain?! Dad?! Are you all right?!

Ed quickly notices something's wrong and approaches.
Will
Ed, Dad's...

He puts one hand to his forehead and the other over the nape of his neck.
Ed
He's cold, could be hypothermia. Can you close the pub?
Will
I'm on it.
Ed
Carry him upstairs, carefully. We need to warm his armpits and thighs. Prepare hot water.
Will
Got it.

I take my father upstairs and do as Ed instructed.

Apparently, the way to deal with mild hypothermia is to warm the person up and get nutrients into them.

I gather from Ed's quick thinking that this isn't the first time he's dealt with something like this.
Will
Thank you. I wouldn't have known what to do if you weren't here.
Ed
Think nothing of it. There are many who fall victim to the same condition wandering through the city at night.
Ed
Needless to say, alcohol is out of the question. It's a diuretic, and that's not what he needs in his condition. Give him warm water to drink.
Will
Okay.
Ed
It would be preferable if he got his appetite back.
Will
Yeah, but he's not been eating at all.
Ed
Then we should contact an apothecary. I have an acquaintance we can call upon.
Will
That'd be great, thank you.

I'm genuinely relieved for a moment, but then the implications of it dawn on me, and I feel my stomach turn into a piece of lead.

I don't have any money on me.

I haven't gotten the other half of my pay from Rob.

Perhaps noticing the gears turning in my head, Ed turns to me with a smile.
Ed
No need to worry about money. I will foot the cost.
Will
But I don't know when I'll be able to pay you back.

To be honest, even with the money Rob still has to give me, we can barely make ends meet.

This could quite literally push us into bankruptcy.

How much does an apothecary even charge for their services?
Ed
Then you can pay me when you become a successful playwright.

I give him a small, sheepish smile.
Will
I don't expect to become a playwright anytime soon, if ever.
Ed
You might very well make it. I believe in you.
Ed
Don't worry. You're not alone.
Will
I feel so pathetic.
Ed
No, you're an upstanding young man.
Will
Thank you. I'm really sorry about all this.
Ed
John has always been there for me. He's a brave soul.
Ed
And you're so very much like him.

He puts on a reassuring smile for me.
Ed
I'll go call him. You stay by his side.
Will
Thanks, Ed.
Ed
Please, think nothing of it. I always enjoy a good meal here.

I go upstairs and sit by my father's bedside.

He still looks to be in a really bad way.
Father
...Sorry.
Will
Mhm.
Father
I'm so pathetic.
Will
It's not your fault.

I refresh the hot water, soak a cloth in it, and wrap it around his arm.
Will
I know you have no appetite, but you need to eat something.
Will
This is happening because of malnutrition.
Father
I know that, but nothing stays down the hatch these days.
Will
...
Father
But I'm useless just prostrated on a bed like this.
Will
That's right. All our patrons only come by to see you.
Father
Hahah...
Will
Ed's fetching an apothecary. He says they can make medicine for you.
Father
An apothecary? No need! I can sleep this off, boy. Don't waste money like that.
Will
It's fine. I just sold a script.
Father
You didn't get paid a fortune for that, I'm sure. Use that for next month's payments.
Will
It's fine! Ed went to call them just for you. It can't hurt to have them examine you.
Father
I suppose...
Will
What is it?
Father
I'm sorry, Son.
Will
I told you, it's fine.
Father
I don't think I'd need an apothecary if I had some ale.
Will
Well you can't be feeling that bad if you're cracking jokes.
Father
I feel like I could get a lot better with some ale.
Will
No, it's a diuretic. You'd just lose more heat.
Will
No tea for you either.
Father
Even if you were to give me something that fancy, I doubt it'd suit my common palate.
Will
Your palate seemed to get on with that venison all right.
Father
Yeah, I suppose that's pretty expensive too, huh?
Will
Try to get some sleep. Are you feeling cold?
Father
Nah, I'm okay.
Will
I'll go tidy things up downstairs. I'll be back when Ed comes.
Father
All right.

I get up from the wooden chair and glance at him one last time before leaving the room.

I return to the pub and clean up the dish and cup I used to serve Ed.

What Rob said yesterday comes back to me.

That Spencer guy keeps deer like one would dogs.

Spencer, huh?

Harold Spencer.

The name has come up many times in my talks with Rob.

He said that the ones who wanted the script today were the Spencer troupe.

I wonder if we could make some kind of deal.

If just one of those deer found its way into my hands, I could slice it up, sell it off, and get my dad any food he wants.

I can't keep relying on Ed's good will forever.
Will
...

I sigh, my shoulders slumping.

How are we supposed to see the light at the end of this tunnel?

My mind is miles away as I carry on tidying up the pub.

After a while, Ed shows up with the apothecary in tow.

All indicates that he's a Catholic as well.

He wouldn't be risking it coming here otherwise.

He examines my father, palpates him, and prepares a few days' worth of medicine for him.

It's to help raise his basal body temperature, apparently.

Thankfully, the amount Ed ends up paying the apothecary is a lot less than I imagined.

Perhaps it's because of Ed's good offices.

In any case, I think I could actually pay it back sooner rather than later.
Will
Thank you for everything, Ed. Without you, I wouldn't have had a clue what to do.
Ed
Don't even mention it.
Will
When Rob comes with the payment for the script, I think I can pay you back.
Ed
I really mean it when I say you can pay whenever it's convenient for you.
Will
I can't do that. Let me pay you. It's money I got from writing scripts, anyway, so you could say I'm already being successful.
Ed
Heh, touche.

He says, chuckling to himself.
Ed
Well, I suppose I'll accept your payment from that script.
Will
Yeah, Rob should be here soon.
Will
Have some ale, on the house. Let's drink and wait for him.

I hand Ed a cup and serve some for myself as well.

He raises his cup up to me.
Will
Thanks again.

I raise mine and clink it against his.

By the time the third bottle's empty, the sound of rain spattering against the roof is impossible to ignore.

Our eyes are drawn to the window.
Will
Rob's not coming, eh?

As I mutter to myself, the front door opens.

He stands at the door, his shoulders wet and heaving.
Will
Oh, hey there!

Rob smiles at me, but it looks awfully forced.

He's holding a bunched up parchment in his right hand that I imagined he tried to hide under his clothing.

It's the same script I gave him earlier.

I only notice that by the fact that it is not wet at all.

He takes a moment to recover his ragged breath.
Will
...

He scratches the back of his head awkwardly.
Rob
Sorry, lad. I stuck around long as I could...
Will
They didn't take the script?
Will
I can rewrite it if they had complaints.
Rob
That's not the problem. He didn't even show up.
Will
Why not?
Rob
It seems like Spencer was attending a play today.
Will
A play?

In other words, he was out enjoying himself at the theater?
Will
But didn't they set the deadline for today?!
Rob
I was under the same impression, yeah.
Will
Did they forget about it?!
Rob
No, uh, mm... Sorry. If for some reason they don't take the script in the end, I'll do something about your money.
Rob
But I need to go to London tonight. I'm really sorry. I just need you to wait a little longer.
Will
No, it's fine. I know it's not your fault. It's just that...
Will
I really need the money.
Ed
Don't stress on my account, Will.
Rob
What? Something happen?

He exchanges glances with Ed.

I nod in response.
Ed
John came down with something.
Rob
The boss?! Say it's not so!
Ed
Malnutrition and hypothermia. His life is not in danger.
Will
Ed called in an apothecary and footed the cost.
Rob
Oh, for the love of..

Rob trails off, and an awkward silence hangs over the room.
Will
Heh, I suppose we've seen better days.

I break the silence.

Rob lifts his gaze to my face.
Will
Can I have the script?
Rob
Huh? What are you gonna do?
Will
I'll hand it over to Spencer myself. I'll wait for him to get back home.
Rob
I can't just let you do that. I'm the middleman here.
Rob
If it's so urgent, I'll pay on their behalf for the time being.
Will
I can't do that to you.
Will
If I keep relying on you two for everything, I won't be able to live with myself.
Will
I'll feel more at ease actually doing something for myself for once. Please.
Rob
Well, you won't be able to enter the estate, so you'd have to wait outside.
Rob
And the guy may not even show up until tomorrow.
Will
It's fine. It'll just mean no mashed potato on the menu tomorrow.

Rob stares at me with an anxious look on his face.

After a tense moment, he sighs and hands over the script.
Rob
Well, it is your script. If you want it back, then you'll have it back.
Will
Half of it is mine, actually. The other half is already paid for.

I hold the parchment in my hand.
Will
I'm sorry, but I think I need to close the pub for tonight.
Ed
Worry not, son.
Rob
Your pub, your rules.

I'm gripping the parchment so tightly that it's starting to wrinkle.

I didn't write this for fun.

I spun this story over two sleepless nights while taking care of the pub.

What the hell is going on?

My dad falls sick, and they don't even have the decency to take the script they asked for in the first place?

I couldn't make this up in one of my tragedies.

Far from letting up, the rain seems only to be increasing in intensity.

I roll up the manuscript and run through the rain in the direction Rob instructed me.

I enter the area where the nobles have their residences, and before long I find myself in front of the Spencer estate.
Will
This is the place?

It's a huge mansion.

How many pubs could I fit in here?

I wonder if this Spencer guy and his peers keep deer in all of these huge gardens.

I sit on one of the stone steps leading up to the mansion.

A thicket of trees in the opulent garden offers a slight reprieve from the biting rain.
Will
...

Now all I can do is wait.

A thicket of trees in the opulent garden offers a slight reprieve from the biting rain.

But despite the bone-chilling cold, the rain is the last thing on my mind.

Rather, my thoughts are with the coming sunrise.

This is my third night in a row without sleep.

My head's starting to feel hazy with fatigue.

And what in the Lord's bones I am going to do after this?

Unable to find an answer, my thoughts go round and round in circles.

I take out the little flask of alcohol I brought to keep myself sharp and take a big swig of it.

The clear, viscous liquid lights up my throat.

It goes down to my stomach, where it settles in a hot, bitter pool.

So many emotions swirl about in my head.

I'm being deprived of my faith, seeing fellow believers put to the blade.

I'm tired of managing a dead end pub, unable to even properly feed my only remaining family.

All while others joyfully enjoy nights out at the theater and fatten deer up in their opulent gardens.

The people living here lead a much better life than we do.

I bet they enjoy lavish dinners a thousand times better than anything my dad has ever eaten.

Are they really so much more noble than us?
Will
Is there a reason?

They must have leftovers.

Surely they have too much here?

Would it kill them to share some?

They're the ones who broke their promise.

I take another swig of my flask.

And the guy may not even show up until tomorrow.

Rob's words ring in my head.

Isn't that convenient for me?

I have to do what I can to make the best of a bad lot.

I don't have the luxury of choice.

If I do nothing, we'll simply starve to death by the wayside, our bodies to be picked at by the rats and the maggots.

I could steal some of what they don't need.

I bet they wouldn't notice if a single deer is missing.

Just one single deer.

It's not like it would ruin them, is it?

It wouldn't affect them in the slightest.

No one would even notice.

And I could feed my dad.

The pub could stay open.

Why, yes.

It wouldn't even be theft.

I'd simply be ever so slightly adjusting this unbalanced distribution of wealth.

Isn't that right?
Will
...It is.

I put my flask away and get up.

Circling around the mansion, I come out into a clearing.
Will
This is it.

Dozens of deer pace about inside a fenced off area.

I feel like one of them makes eye contact with me.

It stares at me for a moment, ears twitching, and then it loses interest and goes back to grazing.

I smash my flask on the fence.

The broken bottle gleams ominously under the moonlight.

Then I take a good scan of the fence from one of its ends to the other.

I see two guards in the distance.

Dad and I spend all our time trying to keep the pub afloat, and these rich bastards can pay for the same amount of people to just stand watch over deer?

What's the damn difference between us?

Why are we deprived of our faith and killed off like animals for the amusement of others?

Is this just our lot in life? Is there nothing else for us?

As self-pity balloons within me, any sense of guilt at the proposition of theft only diminishes.

I'm not wrong. There are too many deer here.

And a single person owns all of them?

They didn't work for any of this. They didn't build this place up with their own hands.

They were simply born into a rich family and inherited this land.

There's a life out there that could be saved with only one of these deer.

Please, God, if you really are up there...

I'm sure you'll forgive the transgression I'm about to commit.

The two guards turn their back on the fenced area and begin chatting among themselves.

Is this my chance?

I lower myself to a crouch and grip the broken flask in my hand.

Then I soundlessly jump over the fence.
Will
Hngh!

I quickly make a beeline for the herd of deer.

But as I approach, the skittish creatures run away on swift hooves.

I manage to grab a deer that lags behind by the horns with my left hand.

I hold it firm and raise the broken flask aloft.

The deer turns its beady eyes towards me.

Its dark pupils stare right at me.

Suddenly, I freeze on the spot.

The deer keeps staring at me.

I screw my eyes shut and swing the sharp, broken flask down—

But something strong and unyielding catches hold of my arm.

I look up to see a brawny, bearded man holding my arm in place.
Will
...

Unsurprisingly enough, I got caught.
Will
...

They tie my hands behind my back and throw me in some corner to wait for their boss to come home.

The rope is so tight, I can't move my hands at all.

But even in the case I could untie it, I wouldn't be able to overpower the guards.

I suppose I have no choice but to wait for judgement.

I can only hope even nobles have some kind of empathy.

If I explain my situation, maybe...

But as I trudge through the thoughts in the bog of my mind, the main door opens.
Guard 1
Lord Spencer!
Guard 2
Welcome home, milord!
Spencer
Hola, yes. What are you doing here? Who are you?

A man in gaudy clothes steps in with a relaxed gait.

He carries himself with a leisure that feels otherworldly.

Is this...

Harold Spencer?
Guard 1
This scoundrel here tried to steal one of your deer, milord.
Spencer
Huh? My venados? Why? You like them?
Will
I...
Spencer
De todas maneras, who even are you people?

Spencer turns to the guards and tilts his head to the side.
Guard 2
Huh? W-We keep watch over the deer.
Spencer
Okey.
Guard 1
We also mow the grass, yes.
Spencer
Huh. Riveting.
Guard 2
And this thief tried to steal one of them!
Spencer
Perdonenme, but I fail to see the conexion between that and you two being here.
Guard 1
Uh, err, well...
Guard 2
W-We wanted to have your judgment on what to do with this lowlife.
Spencer
Juicio? From me? Why?
Guard 1
Lord, I...
Guard 2
This is your estate, and it's your deer, milord.
Spencer
Indeed. They would be my venados, yes.

Spencer sounds plain bored by all this.

The white-haired woman next to him gazes off into the distance, obviously uninterested.
Spencer
Do you have any ideas? Didn't this chico slip by your guard?
Guard 1
H-He dared enter your sacred domain!
Spencer
Mmh...
Guard 1
S-So I believe an execution would be fair retribution. His head must roll!
Will
What?!
Will
You want to kill me?! I didn't even do anything!
Guard 2
You shut up!
Spencer
Mmm, okey. Let's do that, then. This chico is rather handsome, so it'll be a waste, but oh well. Off with his head.
Spencer
Let's get this over with. It's been a while since I last saw blood.
Will
W-Wait! I came here because I was asked to deliver a script to you!
Guard 2
Heh, the guilty are audacious indeed.
Will
And how do you have the right to decide to kill me on the spot?!
Guard 1
...Lad, do you know who this man is?
Will
Huh?! What?!

Spencer looks down at me.

Again, he tilts his head to the side in confusion.

Like the deer from before, his gaze feels like it pierces right through me.
Will
Listen to what I have to say! It's my life you're toying with here!
Spencer
You have something to say? Dimelo todo, let's hear it, then.
Will
It was wrong of me to try to steal from you, I recognize that. I'm very sorry.
Will
My name is William Shakespeare. Your troupe has bought my scripts before!
Will
I came here to deliver one of them!

I try to not sound like a madman while fervently stating my case.
Spencer
Troupe? Ah, yes.

Spencer glances at the woman beside him.
Spencer
Is that so?

The woman just gives him a faint smile.

Then she looks down at me.

The suspicion in her gaze is clear.

The guards exchange glances.
Will
My father... He fell sick, and I...
Spencer
Para. Stop right there.

Spencer closes his eyes and cuts me off.
Spencer
Are you truly a poeta? Sick parents, an unforgivable crime. I've heard it all a thousand times.
Spencer
There is no beauty in it.
Spencer
Your face is far more bella than anything that comes out of your mouth.
Will
But I'm telling the tru—
Spencer
De ninguna manera. No way.
Spencer
Rather than your sob story, I want you see your hermosa face fly off your shoulders.

I open my mouth to try and say something, but realize the noble is not seeing me at all. It's like he's looking down at dirt on his shoe.
Spencer
Off with his head, ahora mismo.
Guard 1
Y-Yes!
Guard 2
U-Understood!
Spencer
*Pant* *Pant* *Pant*
Spencer
It's been a while since I watched someone die. Gracias, chico. Thank you for being born.
Will
Wait! No! Stop!
Spencer
*Pant* *Pant* *Pant* Hooh... Hooh...

There's something wrong with this man!

Is this seriously gonna be how my life ends?!

No! Please!

I don't wanna die!
??
Wait.
Spencer
Hm? What is it, Olive?
??
Are you the same Shakespeare that wrote Richard III?
Will
...

That's the name of a historical drama I wrote on Rob's request a while ago.
??
You wrote that? Truly?

I nod vigorously.

I feel like head will come loose from all the nodding before they can chop it off.
??
Lord Spencer.
Spencer
Yes?
??
This one is worth keeping alive.
Spencer
Porque? Why?
??
He's a poet that can produce the most beautiful verses the world has ever seen.
??
He penned The Taming of the Shrew. Isn't that right?
Will
Y-Yes! That's me!

I wrote that on Rob's request as well.

He sold that to this Spencer guy too?
Spencer
De verdad?! I'll have you know that I thoroughly enjoyed the antics of that drunkard Sly.
Spencer
Did you base that character off someone?
Will
Y-Yeah, I kind of run a pub. I see a lot of drunks, so he was a mixture of all of them.
Spencer
*Gasp* Wow, what a thing!
??
Lord Spencer, I want to take this one for myself.
Spencer
Huh? You'll take this chico?
Spencer
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself, my girl?
??
If he joins our troupe, I'll be able to show you true stories that move the hearts of all who see them.
Spencer
True stories?
Olivia
Yes.
Spencer
Well, well.
Spencer
That is quite the alluring proposal.
??
I am of the same mind.
Spencer
All right. Do as you will, Olive. Just one thing, however.
Spencer
I don't want to hear any rumors of unbecoming behavior, entendido?
??
Yes.
Spencer
Chico, from now on, you are Olive's slave. Buena suerte.
Will
I-I'm what?
Spencer
What a shame. I wanted to see that cute head fly. It would have been hermoso.
??
If he makes me yawn with his verses, I assure you his head will roll in short order.
Will
What?!
Spencer
How maravilloso!
??
You can leave things to me now.
Spencer
All right. Buenas noches, all.
??
Good night, Milord.

A slave? Me?

My jaw is clenched so tight I can hear my teeth grinding together.

The woman just stands there, looking down at me.

Whether it's pity or contempt in her eyes, I can't tell.

But unlike Spencer, at least there's some emotion in them, which makes it infinitely easier to bear.

She turns her gaze to the pair of guards.
??
Go back to your posts. I'll take it from here.
Guard 1
B-But we can hardly leave you alone with this scoundrel, Lady Olivia.
Olivia
Didn't you hear me?
Guard 2
But...
Olivia
Don't make me repeat myself.

Her voice lowers to a growl, and the guards cower behind me.
Guard 1
Uh...
Olivia
Return any belongings he had with him.

The two men are staring at one another at a complete loss, and the woman apparently named Olivia sighs in exasperation.

The guards look genuinely unsure as to what to do.
Olivia
Right now.

It sounds like she's at the end of her wits.

The guards nod, gives Olivia the parchment they took from me, and leave dejectedly.

Olivia then turns back in my direction.

Her gaze is set squarely upon me.
Olivia
You are the William Shakespeare, yes?
Will
Huh?

Her gaze feels like it's piercing right through me.

I slowly nod.

She unfolds the parchment and looks at the script within.
Olivia
A Midsummer's Night Dream. Rather good title.
Will
Thanks...
Olivia
Follow me.
Will
Huh?

Still looking down at my script, she turns and begins walking at a brisk pace.
Will
H-Hey!

Her white hair sways behind her as she goes.

Still with my hands tied behind my back, I chase after her.

It's a typically lively night in Tenbridge.

But Olivia strides ahead with fearless purpose.

Impressively, she still has her eyes on my script.

There aren't as many people to bump into in the middle of the night, but she's still going pretty darn fast.

I can barely keep up, tired and dazed as I am.

The looks the townspeople give me as I follow her sting.

It makes sense, I suppose.

If I saw a tied up man chasing after a girl in the middle of the night, I would stare too.

At this rate I'm gonna fall over, and getting up is not gonna be fun.

I don't care if it's a long walk, but I'd like to at least not be tied up.

Then, all of a sudden, I lose sight of her.
Will
H-Huh?!
Olivia
This way.

I turn towards her voice.

I'm just in time to see Olivia stepping inside a huge building.

White outer walls curve before me, forming a circular building.
Will
Whoa, this is...

Looking back down at my feet, I go in after Olivia.

And when I finally take a breath and look up again, the audience seats spread across my peripheral vision.

It's the Globe Theater.

Tenbridge's greatest theater.

Even I know the name.
Olivia
Is this your first time here?

I look over at her.

She's standing in the middle of the theater, her form beautifully illuminated by the moonlight.
Will
Uh...

Dumbfounded, I stare at her while my sluggish mind tries to come up with an answer.

Her silky white hair flutters in the breeze.

Olivia looks over the empty seats.

I follow her gaze and get a good look at the vastness of the theater. Rows upon rows of empty seats march upwards toward the sky.
Will
I've come here to see plays before, but...

I look at the empty seats again.
Will
It's my first time seeing it empty.
Olivia
Yes. It's quite silent without the people, isn't it?
Olivia
Good place, isn't it?
Will
Yeah.

I take in the scenery and then turn to the stage.

On top of the wooden stage stands a pair of huge vermilion pillars.
Olivia
We can house over two thousand spectators when we have a full house.
Olivia
Even more if we pack in as many groundlings as we can.
Olivia
Just imagining the pleasure of being bathed by the ovation of such an audience puts sex to shame.

My head snaps back to her on reflex.

Her fair cheeks glow under the moonlight like polished marble.

Her attention is focused on the square.

Forgetting to speak, or even breathe, I simply stare at her profile.

Something in her enraptured expression captivates me. It feels like I'm being pulled in by a force majeure.

How can there exist such a beautiful woman?

Without warning, she turns back to me, and our gazes clash.
Olivia
I'm buying you.
Will
...Excuse me?

Buying me? Like a pet?

Or...

Like a slave?
Olivia
I'll keep you as my slave.
Will
A slave.

So both, really.

She's buying and enslaving me like an animal.
Olivia
You'll write.
Will
...
Olivia
For my troupe only.
Olivia
Stories that will set Tenbridge's very heart ablaze and crush the paradigms with your prose.
Olivia
You, and only you, can do this.
Will
Wait a minute now...
Olivia
If you want to keep your head over your shoulders, you have no choice.
Olivia
Write or die.
Olivia
Your choice.
Will
...

Her tone is neutral and monotonous. She stares at me, her mouth set into a hard line.
Will
So...
Will
If I write, I get to stay alive?
Olivia
You won't be suffered to live a second more if you don't.
Will
...
Will
Did I even have a choice to begin with?
Olivia
I suppose not.
Olivia
First, you'll fix this.

Olivia then pushes the script of A Midsummer Night's Dream onto me.
Will
Fix what?
Olivia
It needs more characters and more scenes. It's written well, but people will ask for their money back if it's this short a play.
Will
But I—
Olivia
They won't be able to judge whether it's good or not if the fun is over when it's barely started. Our main visitors are the common folk.
Olivia
I'll wait until tomorrow for you to fix it. Write something bad and it's all over for you.
Olivia
Swear it, right here and now.
Olivia
Swear to me that you will never write stale verses.
Will
...Okay, I'll fix this. I'll do what I can.
Olivia
I won't accept such a lack of committal. You shall write stories that will go down in history together with me.
Will
...
Olivia
Will you swear?

I slowly nod.

Compelled by something besides my free will, I nod.
Will
Olivia, I—

Out of nowhere, she slaps me across the face.
Will
Huh?

The corners of her mouth quirk into a smug smile.
Olivia
Lady Olivia, you meant?
Olivia
Let me remind you that you are my slave.
Will
But...
Will
Ack!
Will
Hey!
Will
Stop!

Dammit all.

This woman—

She's a sadist!
Olivia
Yes?
Will
L-Lady Olivia...
Will
What now?!
Olivia
I can't hear you.
Will
Lady Olivia!
Olivia
Yes. You are my slave, understood?

I nod.

Should I really be nodding to this?

Then again, do I really have a choice here?

After all, I was the one who tried to steal.
Olivia
You will write masterpieces for me even if you end up vomiting blood and having to write with it. You will swear that, won't you?

I nod again.
Will
Why are you still hitting me?!
Olivia
Because I heard no answer.
Will
Yes, I swear!
Olivia
Good boy.

The rope binding my arms is cut.

I rub at my now free and itchy wrists.
Olivia
Are you sure you have time to waste standing around here? Hurry home and write.
Will
All right. Just give me the script.

She thrusts the script towards me.

I reach for it.

But when I pull, she doesn't let go.

I look up, and I'm immediately pierced by her intense gaze.
Olivia
it must needs be remarked that while you wrote this, it is already the troupe's property. The rough draft is a very valuable article for us.
Will
No, uh...
Olivia
Mm?
Will
I've only received half the payment for it.
Olivia
Is that so? You need money?
Will
...

I sullenly nod.
Olivia
Okay. How much do you want?

I tell her the amount Rob promised.
Olivia
Wait right there.

Olivia goes to a room backstage and returns a moment later.
Will
...Thanks.
Olivia
This is the last time you will be remunerated with money. This script was produced before you were a slave, that's why I paid.
Olivia
Understood?

I nod.
Will
Understood, Lady Olivia!
Olivia
Good boy.
Olivia
Now this script belongs to my troupe. I'll have you know that taking the whole thing away with you is not something you'll be allowed to do very often.
Will
Really?
Olivia
Scripts are a troupe's most important asset. What if it were to be stolen?
Olivia
Do take care of it.
Olivia
I'll have you killed if you lose it. This is not a threat, it's a promise.
Will
Yeah, I get it...
Olivia
I'm not playing games here. Promise me.
Will
...Okay.
Olivia
Tell me where you live, just in case.
Will
I'm not gonna run away or—
Will
Gah!
Olivia
Do you perhaps enjoy being struck?
Will
For the love of... I get it already.

I give up and tell her where I live.
Olivia
Ah, that sad little crumbling pub in the gloomy part of town.

I nod.
Will
Pretty much, I guess.
Olivia
I've taken a liking to the scripts you write. Don't you dare disappoint me.
Olivia
That's the only meaning of your life now.
Olivia
Make me sigh from boredom, and you'll stop breathing.
Will
Maybe you should learn how to solve things with something other than murder.
Will
Ugh!
Olivia
I believe I told you how to properly address me, didn't I?

Do all these nobles just solve things by killing off everyone they don't like?

Whatever, at least I can go home now. The wave of relief is helping me keep it together.
Will
...Thanks. I needed the pay.
Olivia
You're five hundred years as a slave short from being worthy of thanking me for anything.
Will
You nobles are real pieces of work.

She looks puzzled for maybe half a second.

Then her mouth settles into a light smile, and she lets out a wry chuckle.
Olivia
It seems that way, yes.
Will
...
Olivia
The words you write are brimming with life.
Olivia
Make me shiver in excitement, understood?

I nod in response.
Olivia
Bring the script here tomorrow before midnight.
Will
Tomorrow?

Right, I didn't sleep last night either.

I've been writing for the last three nights straight.

And now I have to do it again?

I hope I don't pass out.
Will
I'll do what I can. You want me to add more characters and scenes, right?
Olivia
Yes. If you also write something that can move me to tears while you're at it, that would be perfect.
Will
Huh...
Olivia
But if a lowly slave such as you makes me cry, there will be hell to pay.
Will
Are you mayhaps emotionally unstable, La—
Will
I'm very sorry for calling you emotionally unstable, Lady Olivia!

Sighing, I roll up the parchment.
Will
...I'll go back home and write.
Olivia
Go along. I'm serious. Write something boring and you'll be dead. Understood?
Will
I get it. Can I go already?

Olivia nods.

I turn my back on her and walk away.

The coins clink in my pocket.

At least I'll be able to pay Ed.

And we can manage to make it to the end of the month now.

That's something, something good.

Once I'm away from that Olivia woman, I heave a sigh of relief.

So I'm a slave now, huh?

What even is my life right now?

William Shakespeare leaves, his unkempt, golden mane of hair swaying as he goes.

Hair too long for a man.

He has no presence, no propriety.

In his eyes, the look of someone who thinks the world owes him something.

That fixation on money that so many commoners suffer from.

A simple slave, even before we met.

I wonder if that's how I used to be as well.

Have I behaved like a true noble would tonight?

...It's fine. There's no problem.

I've known very well the scorn and indolence with which nobles treat the common folk.

"You nobles are real pieces of work."

The words of Shakespeare still ring in my ears.

That's exactly right.

They're the privileged class.

Have-nots have no choice but to rise above their station with their own power alone.

I slowly turn my gaze upwards.

The circular theater has no ceiling.

I see the moon lazily hanging in the night sky.

It's a full, majestic moon tonight.

I've changed.

I rose above my station on account of my beauty.

But the moon is always constant and unchanging, unlike me.

When I squint, the contours of the beautiful sphere diffuse.

I notice a white glow creeping over the edge of the firmament.

It's almost dawn.

If I stay here until Spencer falls asleep, I'll be able to spend the night out of his bed.
Olivia
...

I sigh.

William Shakespeare.

He has talent.

More than probably anyone else alive.

Perhaps to be surpassed by no one else on this Earth, even after we're long gone.
Olivia
...

If you resent the world, then you must change it with your own two hands.

That's what I did.

...And so should you.

Cursing your circumstances will change nothing.

With William Shakespeare's quill, perhaps I can keep this troupe afloat without making use of Spencer's power.

If we are chosen to perform for the Queen's court and become the Lord Chamberlain's Men, we may have the opportunity to negotiate to change the laws themselves.

That way I could stand upon the stage as a woman without reserve.

Queen Elizabeth loves plays. Her reign is the greatest opportunity to try and enact change.

And above all...

I could end my association with that sick hedonist. I could put an end to being violated every single day...

I am an actress.

In this world that disallows women from taking to the stage, I will coin that word.

And I will do anything to make it happen.

I will roll in bed with that lurdane toad if I have to.

I will even enslave an innocent young man.

Because... I have nothing but this stage.
