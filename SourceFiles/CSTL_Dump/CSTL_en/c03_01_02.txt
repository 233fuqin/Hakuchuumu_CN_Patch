I wake up and grab the clothes I usually wear to the academy.

I just put them on for show and take them off again after eating breakfast and seeing Dad off to work.

I wear different clothes to when I'm working, since I tend to get them dirty pretty fast.

It would be easier if we had a uniform at the academy, but we have no such thing.

I get dressed between drowsy yawns.

Still half asleep, I pull on my pants and button my shirt.

Then I pick up my bag and leave the room.

When I stop by the kitchen on my way out, my dad's just taking a slice of toast out of the toaster.
Dad
Where are you going?
Kanna
The academy.
Dad
It's Saturday.

That's when I realize I've messed up.
Kanna
Oh, right.
Dad
This isn't the first time you've make this kind of mistake. Get your head out of the clouds.
Dad
Besides, it's past 10 AM already. You wouldn't even make it in time.
Kanna
Hahah...

Faking a laugh, I drop my bag, go to the fridge, and take out a milk carton to pour myself a glass.

I spread peanut butter on a slice of toast and take a bite.

Dad continues sipping his coffee, his attention focused on his newspaper.
Kanna
You're gonna stay home all day?
Dad
Mhm.
Kanna
I'm heading out for a bit.
Dad
Mhm.
Dad
Hm, who could that be?

Dad gets up and goes to the door.

Guess I can't go to the garage for the next two days.

I'll just have to go out and take pictures somewhere.

Where should I go this weekend?

I ponder my options while chewing on my toast.

I work through the slice bite by bite between sips of milk.
Kanna
...

Dad's not back yet.

Who was at the door?

I pop the last bit of toast into my mouth and reach out for the glass of milk when...
Dad
Kanna.

Turning around, I see my dad walking into the living room with a young woman in tow.
Kanna
...

She has black hair in a shoulder-length bob. She's wearing black-rimmed glasses and a plain suit.

Her eyes are a striking rose color that are at odds with the rest of her presentation.
Kanna
Who's this?

Dad heaves a huge sigh.

The woman has a troubled smile on her face.
Dad
How long have you been skipping classes?
Kanna
Huh?
Dad
This lady here says she's a student teacher at the academy.

Confused, I look up at my dad.

Then I slowly shift my gaze to the woman next to him.
 ???
My name is Momonouchi Sumomo. It's really nice to meet you.
Kanna
...

Her bright tone sounds really out of place for the situation.

She has an unusual name too. Lots of "momo"s in there. Incidentally, "momo" means "peach" in Japanese.
Kanna
...
Dad
...
Sumomo
...

A long, drawn out silence falls over us.

My dad clears his throat every few seconds.

Each time, the woman looks at my dad, then turns to me and smiles awkwardly.

When she moves, a soft scent quite unlike anything my house usually smells of tickles my nose.

Is it shampoo? Or her detergent?

Get a grip, man. This is no time for getting distracted by smells.
Kanna
Um...

With his eyes still closed, Dad says nothing.
Sumomo
Yes?

Instead, the woman responds.
Sumomo
Amei... Ah, can I call you Kanna?
Kanna
Why?
Sumomo
I mean, your dad's name is Amei too. You can call me Momonouchi, though.
Kanna
...

What's with this lady? Shouldn't she address him with a "Mr"?
Sumomo
So, Kanna, let's see...

She pulls out a piece of paper, and my attention is drawn to it.
Sumomo
So... this has been going on since the latter half of May. You attended three times during June, and none so far in July, right?

My dad sighs again. It sounds like a dragon growling.
Sumomo
Did something happen? Are you having problems at the academy?
Kanna
No, nothing like that.
Kanna
I just don't have time.
Dad
You're a student. How can you have no time?!

When my dad rebukes me loudly, the woman almost jumps in surprise.

I heave a sigh of resignation.

The cat's out of the bag now.

I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

I take a deep breath.
Kanna
I've been in the garage.
Dad
The garage? You mean your mom's?

I nod.
Dad
And what have you been doing in there?
Kanna
...I can't tell you.
Dad
Do you understand the situation you're in? Your teacher came all the way here.
Sumomo
Oh, don't worry about me. I picked the gig myself, so it's not like I'm mad about being made to work or something.
Dad
Why haven't you been going to your classes? I'm waiting to hear a good reason.
Kanna
...

Guess I really have no choice.

I take another deep breath.
Kanna
...I wanna be a photographer.

Eyes on the ground, I mutter the truth.
Sumomo
Photographer?

The woman repeats my last word, as though sounding it out.

She seems a little slow for a teacher.
Kanna
I'm practicing with Mom's camera.

Dad's sigh sounds exasperated now.
Dad
You can do what while attending your classes. That's no excuse.
Kanna
Mom went pro when she was my age. That's excuse enough for me.
Kanna
I'm want to dedicate all my time to it.

He shakes his head.
Dad
Stop being such a kid. Being a photographer just seems more glamorous to you than attending classes, isn't that right?
Kanna
It's not like that.
Dad
You underestimate the career. You can't just ride on your mom's coat tail and suddenly make it work.
Kanna
I know that!

That's not what I'm trying to do.

I've always wanted to be a photographer.

It's always been in my mind.

I just got this far without telling anyone.
Dad
I knew Anna better than anyone else ever could. Not a moment went by when she wasn't thinking about photography.
Kanna
I know that as well as you...

I hear my voice getting smaller.

This is why I didn't want this.

I always shrink down before him whenever we talk.
Dad
Then how about you? I've never even seen you with a camera in your hands.
Kanna
...

I take pictures all the time.

I just don't tell anyone. But I still do it.
Sumomo
Um...

The woman timidly interjects.
Sumomo
Who's Anna?
Dad
My wife. She passed away last year.
Sumomo
Oh... My condolences.

My dad gives her a courteous nod and turns back to me.
Dad
I understand you want to become a photographer, but you can't abandon your studies. What if it doesn't work out?
Dad
You won't have any qualifications.
Kanna
But the later I start, the harder it'll be.
Kanna
When Mom died last year, I realized we never know when our time will be cut short.
Dad
I understand your impatience, but it won't be too late after you finish college.
Dad
Life is longer than you think.
Kanna
We don't know what. What about Mom?
Dad
Kanna, I...
Kanna
But I'm sure Mom didn't regret anything.
Kanna
And that's how I wanna live.
Dad
Do it after graduating college. After that, I won't say a word.
Dad
I'm the one paying for it. At least meet me halfway here.
Kanna
...I never asked you to pay for me.
Kanna
I don't wanna go to university.
Dad
Knock it off with this nonsense!

The woman beside my dad shrinks back a little after that outburst.
Kanna
...Mom would understand.
Dad
What was that?

Silence falls.
Kanna
I... I don't want to be like you.
Sumomo
Kanna, that's a bit...
Kanna
I want to live like Mom did.
Kanna
If I have to be like you to live a long life, I'd rather die young like Mom.
Kanna
I wanna do what I wanna do.

Then, I close my eyes and brace myself.

I expect to get yelled at.

He might even hit me.

I'm sure of it.

But what I hear after the silence is not a slap. It's the sound of his chair dragging across the floor.
Sumomo
Mister...
Dad
...I thought you were more grown up than this.
Dad
I'm disappointed.

And with that, he leaves the room.
Sumomo
Oh...
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Uh, s-sorry?
Kanna
You didn't do anything wrong.
Sumomo
But I kinda wanna scram, you know?
Kanna
Uh, what do you mean?
Sumomo
Like, me? From here? I kinda wanna do like a tree and leave.

She brings the mug of coffee my dad had offered her to her lips.
Sumomo
...Too honest?

I decide to ignore her.

She's getting kinda overly familiar now that my dad's gone.
Sumomo
Anyway, it's not like you hate the academy, right?
Kanna
Not really.
Sumomo
Then why not come? I mean, summer vacation's in five days anyway. Think of it as, like, a change of pace.
Kanna
I don't know anyone there. What's the point?
Sumomo
Duly noted, pal.

What's with this woman?

Is she really a teacher?
Kanna
You heard what I said. I'm not going. I have stuff to do.
Sumomo
But that's a big ol' problem for me, you see.
Sumomo
All I gotta do is make you go to the academy, you feel me?
Kanna
I don't care...
Sumomo
Hear me out, would you? I was told that I wouldn't be recognized as a teacher if I couldn't get you to show up.
Sumomo
And after I finally found an academy willing to do more than just kick my sorry butt out the front door and all. I can't be letting them down now!
Kanna
But why?! It's not even my problem.
Sumomo
I sent a ton of letters and got nowhere. But you wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? Bet they never reached your dad, did they?
Kanna
...

She's right.

I always throw away the letters from the academy before Dad goes to pick up the newspaper.
Sumomo
Sides, don't you kinda need a change of scenery after that spat with your daddy?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I mean, I bet you two'd get along just fine if you came to class for the rest of the semester!
Sumomo
It looked to me like your daddy worries about you a whole lot.
Sumomo
Just one week. Five days, even! And then you'd have a leg to stand on in front of him! Now that's what I call cost effective!
Sumomo
It's only five days out of your whole entire life! Come on!
Kanna
...

For a flickering moment, I see her point.

But then I think it over.
Kanna
I don't wanna half-ass anything. I decided to focus on photography this summer.
Sumomo
The whole summer?
Kanna
Can you leave already, lady?
Sumomo
Hmm, maybe after I have another little talk with your daddy.
Kanna
Whatever.

I get up.
Sumomo
Catch you later. I'll drop by again tomorrow.
Kanna
Why?
Sumomo
You can bet your ass I'll come here everyday until you give in. I want that sweet teaching license.
Kanna
You're so annoying.
Sumomo
If I'm that annoying, just come to class and get me off your back! It's just five days!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
You do know your dad's being a pain in the butt just because he cares, right?
Kanna
Stay out of my business.
Sumomo
And... there he goes.

...

I'm freaking exhausted.

That was super awkward.

Did I really have to see any of that?

They've left me here alone, and it's honestly a relief.

I wonder when any of them will be back.

Sighing to myself, I lean back.

How did things end up like this?

...

Besides, why is it even my job to bring back a dropout? Isn't that a bit much?

I'm only a student teacher, for God's sake.

Why are the professors always punching down? Damn...
Sumomo
...

But Kanna and his dad did call me a teacher.

I must look like one from the outside.

That's fine.. right?

I mean, for now.

That's what I decided, after all.

Even though this ain't the real me.

Man, it's so stuffy.

Wearing a suit in summer is murder.

I'm not even used to wearing this damn thing.

And the wig doesn't make it any better.

I'm not like I'm going to the academy today, so I probably didn't even need to bother.

The mask slipped a little bit with Kanna just now, though.

His dad is staring at the closed door.

Ain't it a bit much to storm off into the back of the house over this?

He said that he lost his wife, right?

He's a man, so he probably feels a bit awkward about the whole thing.

I'll give him some time.

Man, I can't believe I'm wasting my weekend on this.

It's not like I've had much R&R time since my damn teacher training started.

They have me writing stupid reports all day.

And then they complain about my handwriting and force me to stay after hours.

Painting my nails is a no go, as is my brightly-colored hair.

But it's my natural hair, you bunch of mouth breathers!

...
Sumomo
Maybe it's pointless...

Probably is.

It's not like I believe he'd be better off coming to class anyway.

I shake my head to dispel the doubts from my heart.

Mom's crying face flashes through my mind.

I'm sick of making mommy cry because of me.

I don't care for the guy she's with, but she chose him, so whatever.
Sumomo
...

I look around the living room.

It's pretty clean considering there's only men living here.

Kanna and his daddy seem like good, honest folks.

He's probably never skipped classes like this before.

My eyes swim vaguely across the room until a photo on the sideboard catches my eye.
Sumomo
...

I get up and walk over to it.

It's Kanna's daddy and a blonde-haired woman.
Sumomo
Ooh...

She has short hair trimmed above her shoulders.

She looks really happy.

Maybe this is Anna.
Sumomo
Looks kinda cool.

She has a flashy hair color, and her clothes are pretty unique.

Now that's the kind of woman I like to see.

I reach out for the photo, but then I see my reflection in the glass.

So tacky. I look like a trainwreck.

Makes me feel like shit.

It's not like I want people to see me like this.

My hand stops in mid-air, and I leave the picture be.

Then, I hear a door open behind me.
Sumomo
Uh, hey, Mister.
Dad
Oh, you're still here. I'm sorry for that outburst earlier.
Sumomo
Oh, no! I'm sorry for all this. It's kinda my fault for coming here. I...

I can't find the words.

I'm bad at this whole talking with adults thing.
Sumomo
I'm really sorry.
Dad
Don't apologize, please. I'll make you some tea.
Sumomo
Oh, thank you.

I hurry back to the table and sit in front of Kanna's daddy.

His eyes look a little red.

Maybe he was crying.

Raising a kid sure seems tough.
Dad
I'm sorry you had to come here on your day off.
Sumomo
Oh, don't... Yeah, don't worry. It's no big deal.
Dad
I really don't know what goes through his head these days.
Sumomo
Yes... I think he's the talkative type though. Yeah.
Dad
...You do?

I give a weak nod.

Maybe I'm running my mouth again.

I glance at his face.

He seems really deep in thought.
Sumomo
Well, um... When I was Kanna's age, I didn't really talk with my parents much.
Sumomo
Compared to me, you two at least talk to each other.
Dad
I see. How about now?
Sumomo
Now I talk with my mommy. Ah, my mother, I mean.

When I rephrase it, he smiles a little.

He's not as scary as I thought at first.

Thank goodness.
Dad
You don't talk with your father?
Sumomo
Well, uh, I kind of have two of them.
Dad
Huh?
Sumomo
It's just that my mother remarried. Nothing complicated.
Dad
Oh, I see.
Sumomo
I don't really talk with my new father more than I need to. He honestly just feels like my mom's partner rather than family.
Sumomo
I've only seen my real daddy once since the two of them divorced.

Am I maybe getting too personal?
Sumomo
Well, not that my life has much to do with anything.
Sumomo
That's why think it's kind of remarkable of him to be able to say what he wants with such determination.
Sumomo
Being so certain of what you want at that age is kind of incredible.
Dad
...
Sumomo
So maybe you don't need to worry so much...
Sumomo
I mean, being close enough to fight means you two care about each other! I think that's what family's about.

Wait, didn't I tell Kanna the same thing just now?

Way to go, me. Talk about a lack of ideas.
Dad
So he doesn't need to go to the academy?
Sumomo
N-No, that's not what I said.
Dad
I know what you're trying to say. I'm grateful for your words.
Dad
But I'm sure you'll understand when you have kids of your own. If there's a danger in his future he can't see, I want to do what I can to help him to avoid it.
Sumomo
Of course.
Dad
You're a college student doing your teacher training, right?
Dad
You're doing well. I'm sure it must be because of your parents' upbringing.
Sumomo
...

I'm doing well?

Me?

Is he saying that because of the glasses, the black hair, and the suit?

I mean, I haven't been myself since I stepped foot in here.

My parents' upbringing?

What a load of bull.
Dad
I want my son to attend college too.
Sumomo
But why is that?
Dad
Because it'll give him more options.

I tilt my head to the side in confusion.

That's weird. Kanna said he wants to be a photographer.

Does he need other options?

Isn't it a little pointless?
Dad
I'm sorry. This whole thing just has me a little on edge.
Sumomo
Oh, no. I'm sorry for overstepping.

Still dissatisfied with his explanation, I apologize.

I have to keep my head down and just go along with it.

This isn't worth a headache.

At least I can be polite and drop the subject.
Dad
He can be a bit of a handful, but I truly thank you for doing what you can to help him.
Sumomo
O-Of course.

He bows to me.

He's literally almost hitting the table with his forehead.

And he's not coming back up at all.

Doing what I can to help him? What am I supposed to do with that?
Sumomo
...
Dad
...

Uh-oh. I don't think this is gonna end until I say something.
Sumomo
Uh, sooo... Would you mind if I spoke with him one-on-one next time?

Finally, he raises his head.
Dad
Please do.

I heave a barely noticeable sigh.

This teaching thing sure is rough.
Kanna
...

I can still hear him inside my head.

If I close my eyes, I can still see his shoulders slump as he leaves the room.
Kanna
What the hell?

I would've preferred it way more if he hit me.

At a loss, I sump down onto the sofa.

I hate this.

Now I can work on the weekends as well.

I no longer have to pretend to go to class every day.

I don't have to sneak around.

I can be in the garage all day.

Isn't that good? Isn't that what I wanted?

I try to convince myself.

But I still feel like a sack of potatoes.

While I stare at the ceiling and stew in my thoughts, I hear a knock on the door.
Kanna
...

The garage door slowly opens, and from it appears... the lady from before.
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
Um, I was just about to head home.
Kanna
Then leave. You don't need permission.
Sumomo
Whoa, this is pretty cool! It's like a secret base.
Kanna
...

It's like she's not even listening to me.
Sumomo
This place looks cozy, that's for sure.
Sumomo
Can I come in?
Kanna
Why?
Sumomo
I told your dad I'd try talking to you.
Kanna
I don't care.
Sumomo
He looked really sad, you know?
Kanna
...

Suddenly, I feel a knot form in my throat.

I knew that, but I still didn't want to hear it.
Sumomo
Can I come in?
Kanna
Do whatever.
Sumomo
Then don't mind if I do!

She slowly walks into the garage.

Her scent hits my nose again.

A soft peachy scent.
Sumomo
Now this place just screams 'man cave.'
Kanna
...

She stops to look at the pictures pinned to the corkboard.
Sumomo
Your mom took these?

Wordlessly, I nod.
Sumomo
Wow, that's awesome. I saw her picture in the living room just now. She was such a pretty woman. Like, I'm jealous.
Kanna
...

Did she talk about my mom with Dad, too?

What did he tell her about me?
Sumomo
That's a huge car! It's so cute! Does it run?
Kanna
Not right now, but I'll get it working within the month.
Sumomo
Yeah? Nice. Looks perfect for camping.

With that, she walks up to me.
Sumomo
Mind if I sit?

Again, I simply nod.

Holding down the hem of her skirt, she perches next to me.
Sumomo
You mentioned it before, right?
Kanna
Mentioned what?
Sumomo
That you wanted to focus this summer. On your photography, right?
Sumomo
And you're fixing the car this summer, right? Something going on this summer?
Kanna
...Not really.
Sumomo
Geez, throw me a bone here, would you?
Kanna
We just met today. Why would I tell you anything about myself? That'd be weird.
Sumomo
Duly noted, again.
Sumomo
But I'm kind of your teacher, you know? Even if I'm just on probation and stuff.
Sumomo
It's not like we're COMPLETE strangers.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
You gonna come next week?
Kanna
No. There's no reason for me to go.
Sumomo
Why not?!
Kanna
I already made it clear I'm becoming a photographer.
Sumomo
To your dad?

I nod.
Sumomo
Hmm, I see. Well, if you wanna be a photographer, I guess you don't see much point in going to college.
Kanna
But other people do?
Sumomo
Your dad might be blaming himself. Asking himself if he raised you badly and stuff.
Kanna
...How do you know that?
Sumomo
Because my parents were like that.

I look up at her.

My gaze meets hers.
Sumomo
I didn't really go to class much either.
Kanna
Haah...
Sumomo
I just really hated going, though.
Kanna
...Why?
Sumomo
Do you need to ask? Who wants to go to class? It's such a damn drag.

I just keep looking up at her without giving a response.

Is that what a teacher is supposed to say?
Sumomo
Uh, forget I said that. I forgot I'm the teacher here for a second.
Kanna
...

This woman's wrong in the head.
Sumomo
Anyway! I think it'd be better if you looked for a way to convince your dad.
Sumomo
From what I heard, it doesn't sound like he's really against you being a photographer.
Kanna
...I know.
Sumomo
Really?!

She gets so loud of nowhere that it takes me by surprise.
Sumomo
So you're gonna come to class?!
Kanna
I don't know about that.
Kanna
But I'll talk with him again. It may take some time, though.
Sumomo
Thank goodness! I'd feel bad for weeks if I, like, ruined this family or something.
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
I mean, you guys got into this fight because I showed up.
Kanna
...It's not your fault.
Sumomo
But I was still, like, the trigger.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Okay then! I'll see you at school on Monday!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Right?!

Saying nothing, I turn my eyes straight ahead.

She stares at me from the side for a while, sighs, then gets up.

And then she leaves, as fast as she came.

She's totally different to what you'd expect from looking at her.

But I see where she's coming from.

Even if I wanna be stubborn, time's still ticking by.

I get up from the sofa and grab a sketch from the corkboard.
Kanna
...

It's a sketch my mom left behind.

It shows Halley's Comet surrounded by a conifer forest.

It looks like one of those photos taken from the inside of a cave with a hole in the ceiling.

The paper is yellowing.

She might have drawn it before I was even born.

I'm sure my mom envisioned taking her picture of the comet from this place.

And it now falls to me.

Turning around, I stare at Hachimaru.

The leaflet from yesterday comes to mind.
Kanna
...

I'm running out of time.

If I want to get the car up and running in time for summer, I'll need more hands on deck.

I wanted to fix it myself, but I can't be picky now.

Taking the dubious mechanic's flyer out of my pocket, I take a closer look at the request form at the bottom.

I fill in the necessary info and mark the “Come to my garage” box, adding brief directions on how to get here.

If Dad finds this, he'll be all up in my ass again.

In the desired date column, I circle the “fastest available date” options.

The address is a PO box at the Nariyama Post Office.

Maybe I could even get a response today.

That is, if I can deliver the letter while it's still early.

I put the completed request form inside an envelope and stamp it for same day delivery.

I drop it in the mailbox then return to my spot on the sofa.

What do I do now?

I don't think I wanna see Dad right now.

I know we'll need to talk at some point.

But I'd rather talk to him after the situation changes a little.

For the time being, I guess I'll stay out here.

I turn my eyes to the camper.

I can sleep in there, thankfully.

When I open the door, all the heat that was trapped inside rushes out and hits my face.

This camper was my mom's workplace.

But that doesn't mean it's a dark room for anything.

There's a large monitor for checking photos and a strong anti-shaking lens holder.

There's also a high-spec printer and ladder that leads up to a bed for napping.

I climb up and lie on the bed.

Sumomo's words echo in my mind as I look up at the ceiling of the car.

I ended up hurting dad, huh?

...

While the garage can get really stuffy during the day, it cools down at night.

I'm even starting to feel a little chilly.

I already received a reply in the mailbox about the mechanic request.

“I'll be there on the 10th,” it said.
Kanna
So tomorrow. They work fast, huh?

I look up from the letter and over at Hachimaru.

Will it work again?

And if it does, can I really drive it?

...It'll be fine.

I still remember how its motor purred as we drove up to the campsite in the mountains.

I remember the feel of the clutch, too.

I'm not completely inexperienced.

I can do it.

I should be able to.

...Even if I don't have a license.
