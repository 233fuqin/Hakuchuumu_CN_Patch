Arishima
...

I had a dream about Rin.

I was a student, and I was sitting right in front of her.

If we'd met under different circumstances, maybe that's the kind of way we could have interacted.

When my wife appeared, I went back to being middle-aged.

I went back to who I am.

Then my wife disappeared, leaving me and Rin alone.

It was a weird dream, for sure.

I wish I didn't wake up.

I look at at the wall clock.

Monday morning, 5 a.m.

I let out a tired sigh.

It's the start of a new week.

How long was my wife's trip to Osaka again?

I reach out for my phone to ask her, then stop.

The dream from just now flashes through my head.

Our lives couldn't be more separate right now.

There's no need to ask. It doesn't matter.

I still feel sluggish.

Probably because I fell asleep in front of my PC on Saturday.

It's a good thing my wife wasn't around this weekend.

Thanks to that, I was able to focus on writing all weekend long.

If I got tired of writing in my room, I could move into the living room.

And whenever I got stuck, I could pace around the house.

One word at a time.

My first novel in years is taking shape.

I guess I do still like writing after all.

Knowing that makes my heart feel a bit lighter.

I get up and stretch my limbs out.

I didn't get much sleep over the weekend, so I'm fatigued, yet somehow I still feel lighter.
Watanabe
Geez, you look like a panda.

I turn to Watanabe.

Seeing his concerned look, I let out a little snort.

Yeah, I suppose it's does look pretty bad.

The bags under my eyes don't lie, and I'm no spring chicken anymore.

I was awake all night through the weekend, so it's obviously taken its toll.

From the way he's frowning, I imagine my laughter isn't serving to reassure him.
Watanabe
You okay? Don't tell me you started doing drugs or something.
Arishima
Just this one.

I say, raising my cig.
Watanabe
For real? You kinda look possessed or something.
Arishima
You could say I am.
Watanabe
...

It's been three days since I started the draft.

I had twenty years worth of pent-up drive that I just had to get out of my system.

Even if I'm not talented and it's not particularly good, I still need to write.

And I gotta admit, it feels damn good.

The more clearly I delineated the difference between me and Shuho, the more the haze inside my mind seemed to clear.

I don't need to write hundreds of pages.

For now, I simply decided to write for this one week.
Watanabe
Anyway, remember the last time we went drinking? Remember how we talked about that girl?
Arishima
Hm?
Watanabe
The second-year girl. Hatano.
Arishima
Oh, yeah.
Watanabe
I hear you've been having lunch together?
Arishima
...
Watanabe
At the cafeteria.
Arishima
Yeah, I guess we did. What, you saw us? Could have said hi.
Watanabe
Nah, I didn't see you guys.
Arishima
Huh?
Watanabe
Remember, this is a school campus, Professor Arishima. What do you think is the number one concern for these kids?
Arishima
Their midterms?
Watanabe
GET REAL!

He shouts so loud that the flimsy walls of the smoking room tremble.
Watanabe
It's love! Boys and girls! Rumors, scandals! Getting married turned your head to mush or what?!
Arishima
Err, I don't really think about that stuff?
Watanabe
Oh, for the love of...

Watanabe heaves an exasperated sigh.
Watanabe
Didn't I tell you? She stands out. People are jealous of her.
Watanabe
You thought THAT Rin having lunch with a male professor in the middle of the cafeteria would go unnoticed? Like, really?
Arishima
...Maybe if it was you. I'm turning 45 this year.
Watanabe
That's neither here nor there.
Watanabe
Anyway, I think it'd be better if you didn't draw so much attention to yourself. You don't like that kind of thing, do you?
Arishima
Mmh...
Watanabe
Don't worry, I know you didn't have any ulterior motives or anything.
Arishima
...

I'm unable to respond straight away.
Watanabe
Huh? You didn't, right?
Arishima
Don't be stupid.
Watanabe
Yeah, yeah, right!

I finish my afternoon lectures and the usual paperwork that comes with the job.
Arishima
Have a good evening, everyone.

The professor at the desk beside mine looks up and nods in acknowledgment.

Instead of going to the library, I head straight home.

The sky is still light.

How many years has it been since I last went home this early?

I glance at the library from a distance.

I wonder if Rin's reading another one of her dad's books today.
Arishima
...

I'll try to keep myself from talking to her for a while.

At least until I finish writing this.

I do feel a little disappointed that I won't be spending time with her.

But then I remember the dream I had last night.

If we were both students, we might have gone to the library together.

We'd talk about our favorite books, and maybe a friendship would blossom.

But the fact remains that our positions are completely different.

She's a student, and I'm a professor.

Our only points of slight contact are in the library and the classroom.

It's too frail to call it a bond.

I turn my back on the library and head home.

I make it back before the sun dips over the horizon.

Stepping through the front door, I notice my wife's shoes in the entryway.

And a pair of male shoes that I don't recognize.

They're sneakers. I don't own shoes like these.

I look down at the pair of shoes for a while.

Then I hear the door of the living room open and raise my head.

My wife is peering out from behind it.
Shouko
...Aren't you a bit early?
Arishima
Yeah.
Shouko
What happened?
Arishima
Nothing.
Shouko
Oh...

Averting her eyes from me, she falls silent.

I think she's trying to think of what to say.

The collar of her blouse is clearly out of place.

Why do I notice this?

It's not like we care about each other.

I curse my powers of observation.

Unsurprisingly enough, she says nothing as her eyes wander about aimlessly.
Arishima
...So it was until today, huh?

She turns to me again.
Shouko
What was?
Arishima
Your work trip.
Shouko
Yeah.

She nods in response.
Shouko
One of the writers I'm in charge of just stopped by for something. He'll be gone soon.
Arishima
I see.
Shouko
Sorry.
Arishima
It's fine.

I take off my shoes and go upstairs.

Entering my room, I close the door behind me.

I let my bag fall to the floor.

The sounds of people drift up the stairs.

The clink of cups against wood.

Did she make coffee for him?

Have I ever drank coffee made by her in this house?

Then I hear the sound of water running.

Maybe they're washing the cups.

The sound continues for a while.

After it stops, I hear the door of the living room open.

Two sets of footsteps walk toward the front door.

In the end, it's over without me ever even seeing what the man looks like.

I hear the door open and close.

And then, silence.

I heave a huge sigh.

It's quiet.

I walk to my desk by the window and take a seat.

Leaning back in the chair, I stare up at the ceiling.

I'm not even disappointed at this point.

Our relationship has gone cold and dead.

I'm not about to try and press my idea of fidelity onto her.

Still, my chest feels prickly.

I don't understand this feeling.

Do I have some kind of lingering attachment to her?

She said that she's in charge of a young writer.

I understand the enthusiasm of a budding novelist.

Maybe it stirred the woman inside of her; a woman of flesh and desire.

Nah, she's always been that woman. Just because she doesn't show that side of herself to me doesn't make it any less real.

I have to laugh at myself.

In the end, we're very alike.

At some point living together in this house, we both withered away.

And, with coincidental timing, we've both been blessed with a small sprout of youth that we're now clinging to.

I don't blame or condemn her.

I understand how she feels.

I'm the same.

Bored to death of everyday life.

Accepting it out of sheer laziness.

Being disgusted with and feeling pity for yourself.

Impatience and resignation becoming your default state of mind.

...I know that very well.

I won't point the finger.

But I won't forgive either.

I want to escape this inexorably dull slide toward death too.

I'm not living like this because I like it.

Time keeps marching on, no matter what I do.

And the only resistance I can put up is...

I turn on the laptop, input my password, and smash the Enter key with more force than needed.

I'll change this everyday routine the only way I know how.

By writing.

I open the draft file and begin typing away.

After a while, I settle into a comfortable rhythm.

The prickly feeling in my chest goes away.

I just focus on the sentences taking form in my mind.

By the times my eyes get tired and I tear them away from the screen, it's already dark outside.

I look at the clock.

It's after 10 p.m.

I pinch bridge of my nose.

After easing some of the tension with that, I stand up and stretch.

I realize that my mouth feels dry.

When I go down to the living room, I find my wife at the table reading something.
Shouko
...

She raises her face to look at me.

I give her a small nod and head to the kitchen.

As I walk past the dining table, I glance at the novel she's reading.

It's a galley proof.

Probably the work of that young writer who was here earlier.

I pick up the kettle and set some water to boil.
Arishima
Want some coffee?

She looks up and stares at me for a moment.
Shouko
Yeah. Thanks.

I nod, put enough water for two cups in the kettle, and turn it on.

I set up the drip coffee bags in the cups and wait for the water to boil.

While I wait, I lean back against the kitchen counter and stare at her.

Her long bangs brush against her mouth.

The years are showing.

For both of us.

There are faint laugh lines forming around her mouth.

And there are deep crow's feet carved into the corners of her eyes.

Despite this, I still think she's a beautiful woman.

I don't really think I can make a calm assessment of her at this point.

But I'm certain she's more valuable than I am in the dating market.

Noticing my gaze on her, she looks my way.
Shouko
What?
Arishima
Nothing, really.
Arishima
Was just wondering about what you're reading.
Shouko
A galley proof.

She leans back in her chair.
Arishima
Is it well written?
Shouko
Yeah. I'd say it is.
Shouko
It'll probably be a hit with younger readers.

I nod.
Shouko
Wanna read it?
Arishima
Nah. I don't think I'd have any useful opinions to offer.
Shouko
Huh.
Arishima
Is it by the writer who was here earlier?
Shouko
Yeah.

Her eyes are fixed on the manuscript.
Arishima
...

...I'm writing now too.

If I tell her that, would it change anything?

Would she look at my draft with the same attention she's giving to the one in front of her?

The water boils.

I pour the water evenly between the two cups.

After putting the kettle back in its place, I grab the steaming cups.

I hand one of them to my wife.

She takes it without a word, and turns once again to the paper in her hand.

It's covered in scribbles of red pen.

The line edits and notes of a professional editor.

She takes a sip of coffee and focuses on reading.
Arishima
...I'm writing too.
Shouko
Huh?

She looks up at me.
Arishima
I'm writing a novel.
Shouko
...Why?
Arishima
I wanted to write.

She looks up at me, an awkward silence taking form.
Shouko
Today? Out of nowhere?

I shake my head.
Arishima
I started at the weekend.

She nods slowly.
Arishima
...Would you read it?
Shouko
...

She bites back a laugh.

With the smile from the little outburst still on her face, she looks up at me.
Shouko
Now? Aren't you about ten years too late?
Shouko
What? Are you trying to insinuate something? You think you can try and guilt trip me over something?
Arishima
...
Shouko
Do your best with your little novel.

I nod and leave the living room with my coffee in hand.

I knew this would happen.

I just wanted to tell her.

That she's not the only one disillusioned and tired of this life.

I'm not happy with the way I am right now either.

That's why I'm trying to change.

I go back to my room and return to working on my draft.
