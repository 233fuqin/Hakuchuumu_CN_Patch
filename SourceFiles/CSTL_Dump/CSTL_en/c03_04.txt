Sumomo
It's so nice and cool in here. Is this heaven?

Sumomo languidly remarks, resting her chin on the palm of her hand.

Today is July 15th.

Halley's Comet will be the closest to Earth on July 28th.

We have less than two weeks.

The city is bustling today.

But we're here in the library to search for the location in my mom's sketch.

The list of possible sites is complete.

One by one, I ruled out the places where I knew the composition of the sketch couldn't be recreated.

It shouldn't take too long to narrow down the search now.
Sumomo
So what now? We're here to find out where that sketch is supposed to be, right?
Kanna
Yeah.

We pile up books with pictures and descriptions of national campsites, mountains, riverbanks, and forests on the table.
Kanna
I made a copy of the list for you too.
Sumomo
Okay.

I hand the piece of paper to her.

It's a copy of the stuff I wrote in my notebook.
Kanna
I'm gonna check from the top. Can you start from the bottom so we can meet in the middle?
Kanna
We should be able to find photos of everywhere on the list in these books, so let's look for places that could match the sketch.
Kanna
If it's a place my mom chose, maybe it's somewhere well known.
Sumomo
Okay! I'll give it a go.
Sumomo
I'm pooped!

Stunned, I raise my face from the books and turn to her.

I wasn't counting, but it probably hasn't been more than twenty seconds.
Sumomo
Aren't the letters super tiny?! Like, for real?!
Kanna
You don't have to read, just look at the pictures.
Sumomo
Well, I guess this IS our secret project! I better put my back into it!
Kanna
Right...
Sumomo
Okay, no. I can't do this.
Kanna
What?!
Sumomo
You know what they say about book smart versus street smart? I don't think I'm a book kinda gal.
Kanna
I'm surprised you made it so far in university.
Sumomo
When I started, it'd been ten years since I last picked up a mechanical pencil.
Sumomo
Man, I couldn't even believe they still sold them!
Kanna
Okay, forget about the list. Go find some of my mom's articles. She might have written something about it.
Sumomo
Your mommy wrote stuff?! Yes! I'll totes do that!
Sumomo
Holy camera magazines, Kanna!

While I work through my list, Sumomo goes looking for camera enthusiast magazines and returns with a stack of back issues.
Sumomo
Your mom's amazing! Her name comes up in a lot of magazines.
Kanna
They sold well enough, apparently.
Sumomo
Wheee, I can't wait to read her articles!
Kanna
The letters are smaller than the ones before, though. You gonna be okay?
Sumomo
Hello? They're Anna's articles! Of course I can read ‘em.
Kanna
...

Despite my doubts, she actually sits down and quietly reads through the articles featuring interviews with my mom.
Sumomo
Ooh, so she smoked too. Do all car enthusiasts have a thing for cigarettes? Our scrap hunter's the same.
Kanna
I don't think it has much to do with cars.
Sumomo
You think?
Kanna
You don't smoke?
Sumomo
I've tried it once or twice, but it's sooo gross, I always stopped after one puff. It makes me cough, the stink sticks to your clothes and hair, and it ruins your teeth.
Kanna
Sure does.
Sumomo
Oh, it's her!

Sumomo cheerfully shows me the page of a magazine.

It's an advertisement for a compact digital camera that my mom's promoting.

It shows my mom in an urban area, crouching down and pointing her camera toward a cat.
Kanna
She used to appear in commercials too, I heard.
Sumomo
Really? This camera's so cute and small.
Kanna
There's one in the garage.
Sumomo
Really?!
Kanna
I think it's a sample product. It's old, but pretty much unused.
Sumomo
I wanna use it!
Kanna
Huh?
Sumomo
I wanna try taking photos too! Can I borrow the camera?
Kanna
Sure, I don't mind. No one's using it.
Sumomo
Teach me how!
Kanna
Huh?

There's an intensity to her gaze that overpowers me a little.
Sumomo
Teach me how to use it!
Kanna
Me? Teach you?

Beaming, Sumomo nods vigorously.
Sumomo
This time you'll be my teacher!
Kanna
I don't think there's much I can teach.
Sumomo
That's just not true. You take super slamming photos. Teach me the tips and tricks, come on!
Kanna
Well, sure.
Sumomo
Right on! Let's go take photos together somewhere tomorrow, before we come back here!
Kanna
Let's go to the terminal, then. It's close by, cooler than here, and there's not many people.
Sumomo
Sounds good!
Sumomo
I can't wait!

With that, she goes back to reading articles.

I stare at her for a while as she flips through the pages, humming a happy tune to herself.

It's kind of curious, now that I think about it.

I'm hanging out casually with the person who was teaching my class not so long ago.
Sumomo
Hm?

Noticing my gaze on her, she tilts her head a little in confusion.
Kanna
Don't mind me.

I continue checking locations against my list while listening to her humming.
Sumomo
Anna was really cool, huh?
Sumomo
She reads so natural in all of her interviews. Like she doesn't put on airs, you know?
Kanna
Was there anything about the sketch in there?
Sumomo
Nope, nothing at all. But she did talk a lot about you.
Kanna
Really? What article is that?
Sumomo
She wrote that her son is a lot like her.
Kanna
Oh.
Sumomo
Now I'm wondering if you'll be like that when you get older. You're gonna be swatting women away left and right.
Kanna
Wait, why?
Sumomo
Genuine men are a hit with the ladies. And you're really good looking too.
Sumomo
If you lose that edginess you've got going on, you'll be the hottest boy in town.
Kanna
...I'm not trying to be edgy.
Sumomo
Ahahah! That's what I'm talking about!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
You said it's a compact camera, right?
Kanna
Yeah, compact digital camera.
Kanna
That's it.
Sumomo
I can't wait to get my hands on it! I'm gonna take so many pictures!

We walk to the garage together.

The sun is already setting.
Kanna
By the way.
Sumomo
Hm?
Kanna
Where's your place? It's not this way, is it?
Sumomo
Ah! Crap! You're right!
Kanna
You don't need to go back?
Sumomo
What's today's date?
Kanna
Huh?

Sumomo stops and puts a finger to her lips. You can practically see the wheels turning in her head.
Kanna
It's July 15th.
Sumomo
Oh, crud.
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
I rent weekly...
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
The contract ended today.
Kanna
...

Sumomo stares into my eyes as the corner of her mouth quirk into a grin.
Sumomo
Eheh?
Kanna
You've gotta be kidding me.
Azuki
Peach is moving in here too?! Why?!
Sumomo
The contract at the place I was staying only lasted for my training period. And the rent's crazy expensive.
Azuki
Then what?! I'm gonna sleep on the floor now?!
Sumomo
Come on! We can sleep together! I mean, it's a sofa bed, right?
Kanna
Well, yeah but...
Azuki
It's too crowded in here! Go book a hotel room or something!
Sumomo
Whaat?! We're spending the whole summer together but you want to send me off to a hotel by myself?!
Sumomo
No way! We gotta live like a team if we wanna be one! I don't mind sleeping on the floor.
Azuki
You think we'd let you sleep on the damn floor?
Sumomo
Where are you sleeping, Kanna?
Kanna
Inside the car.
Sumomo
Can't we sleep in there together?
Kanna
It's cramped enough with just one person. Besides..

There are only about two weeks left until July 28th.

Can I keep all this hidden from Dad during that time?

I mean, I have two women sleeping in his garage...

How do I even begin to explain that?
Sumomo
Oh, it'd be bad if we didn't tell your daddy about this.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Want me to try talking with him?
Kanna
It'll only become a problem if he knows!

I turn to the camping equipment in the back of the garage.
Kanna
We do have some sleeping bags lying around, so we can probably figure out some kind of sleeping arrangement.
Sumomo
How are things with your daddy these days? Do you talk?
Kanna
I told him I started going to class, but that's it.
Sumomo
You're going on that comet shoot without him knowing? We're probably gonna have to travel quite far to find that place.
Kanna
...
Kanna
I don't know yet, but probably.

Pursing my lips, I think for a moment.
Kanna
Anyway.
Kanna
It'd be too dangerous to do all this without saying anything, so I'll tell him...
Kanna
...that some friends came to stay over at the garage, and that he should keep out.
Azuki
I did it! I'm Candy's friend, you hear?
Sumomo
More like we did it!
Kanna
*Sigh*

The lights are on inside.

I take a deep breath.

I have good news for him.

I went to class until the closing ceremony, like he wanted.

Now I can focus my time on the camera without leaving anything undone.

I'll tell him about that first.

Then I'll tell him the other part while he's in a good mood.

I can do this. I can do it.
Kanna
Okay...

I find him reading a book on the sofa again.

It's a plain looking book. Work-related, probably.
Kanna
Um...
Dad
Mhm.

When I call out, he slowly lifts his face from the book.
Kanna
Can we talk?
Dad
Sure.

He closes the book and looks up at me.

Still standing at the entrance to the living room, I take a quiet breath.
Kanna
The closing ceremony was today.
Kanna
The summer break starts tomorrow. I'll be in the garage, but I'm not just loafing around.
Dad
I see.
Dad
How was it? It had been a while, right? Could you follow the lessons?
Kanna
Yeah. I'm fine on that.

He nods.
Kanna
This summer...
Kanna
Halley's Comet is coming this summer. It's a chance that comes around only once every 76 years, and I...
Kanna
I want to photograph it in Mom's place.
Kanna
I want to take the photograph she wanted to take.
Dad
Mhm...
Kanna
This summer, if I...
Kanna
If I get visible results, then I want to talk again seriously.
Kanna
About whether I'll go on to further study or start working right after graduating.
Kanna
And I hope you'll listen to me.

He remains silent.

But then he gives me a little nod.
Dad
You're planning attend classes next semester, right?

I answer with my own nod.
Dad
All right.
Kanna
...
Kanna
Thanks.
Dad
Mhm.

He picks up his book again and begins flipping through pages.
Kanna
Also...
Dad
Mhm.

This time he doesn't take his eyes off the pages.
Kanna
Some, uh, friends are coming over and I was wondering if it'd be okay if they stayed in the garage.
Dad
Friends?

He looks up at me again.
Dad
From college?
Kanna
...Yeah. Totally.
Dad
And you're making them stay out there? Why not your room?
Kanna
The garage is fine. The place has good ventilation, plus there's a fan and a fridge with cold drinks.
Kanna
They may be there for a while during summer break, so try to stay out of the garage in the meantime, if you can.

He blinks curiously at me a few times.
Kanna
So, uh, that's it. See you.
Dad
Yeah.
Kanna
Phew...

For now, I've said what I had to say.

I left out some details, but it's the truth for the most part.

It's actually the first time I've been able to tell my dad what I want.

Feeling way more accomplished now than I did during the closing ceremony, I go back to the garage.
Sumomo
Oh, Kanna. How did it go?
Kanna
Well enough.
Sumomo
Did he say we could stay?
Kanna
Yeah, I told him you'd be here.
Sumomo
Great!
Azuki
Imagine taking in two hot babes to live in with you. This'll be the best summer break ever for you, eh, lucky Candy?
Kanna
It's more like you two invited yourselves here.
Sumomo
I'm gonna go get my stuff. It's only a case about this big and a big bag about this size.
Kanna
You mean the big black bag you always carry around?
Sumomo
That same one! Give me thirty mi—scratch that. I'll be back in an hour.
Kanna
Gotcha.
Azuki
Go get us something from the convenience store while you're at it.
Kanna
No alcohol.
Azuki
Why not?!
Kanna
Because you get drunk. And then you hurl.
Azuki
Scrap Hunter Azuki does no such thing! What are you even talking about?!
Sumomo
Ahahah! I don't wanna get barfed on, so maybe next time.
Azuki
You bitch!
Sumomo
Hag!
Azuki
Wha?!
Sumomo
Ahahah! I'll bring some snacks instead. Or something more filling? Cup noodles?

I nod.
Kanna
Thanks, I'm kinda hungry.
Sumomo
Sure thing. See you guys in a bit.
Kanna
Sure.
Azuki
Who you calling a hag?!
Azuki
What a rude slag! Did you hear that, Candy?! Can you believe the gall of her?!
Kanna
One question at a time...
Azuki
Lock the doors, Candy! Lock the garage up right now! Make that bitch regret messing with me!
Kanna
As long as you keep getting mad over it, she'll keep calling you a hag.
Azuki
Who are YOU calling a hag?!
Sumomo
Hellow!
Azuki
Hmph!

A little over an hour later, Sumomo comes back dragging two large bags with her.

While she was gone, I kept scouring the books I borrowed from the library.
Kanna
What's with the clothes?
Sumomo
Lounge clothes! I took a shower too! But I got all sweaty again on my way back.
Sumomo
Not enough to need another shower, though!
Kanna
Where do you wanna sleep?
Sumomo
This sofa here. It's a sofa bed, right?
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
Both us girls can sleep together, right, Azuki?
Azuki
Apparently I'm not young enough to be called a girl, remember?
Sumomo
Hm? What're you sulking about? Is the menopause hitting you?
Azuki
Candy! I'm not sleeping with Peach! You sleep with her!
Sumomo
No!
Kanna
Could you two stop it, for the love of...
Sumomo
Please, Azuki! We girls gotta stick together!
Sumomo
Lemme have half of the sofa, come on!
Azuki
Hngh... Don't you dare come out of your half, though. One finger on my side and you're going to the floor.
Sumomo
Okay! You got it!
Kanna
It's my garage and my sofa, though.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Duly noted!
Kanna
Oh, and here you go.

I take the pink compact digital camera out of its dusty box and hand it over to her.
Sumomo
Oh, the camera! And it's pink! It's the same as Anna had in the picture!
Kanna
She didn't use it very much.
Sumomo
Oh, really?
Kanna
But it's not a bad camera. The battery's charging right now. You'll be able to use it by tomorrow.
Sumomo
Thanks! It's sooo cute! I love it!
Sumomo
I can't wait for tomorrow! I'm gonna take a whole bunch of pictures of you!
Kanna
You can photograph better things than my face in Terminal 1.

After looking the little pink camera all over with sparkles in her eyes, she carefully slips it into her bag.
Kanna
What did I say about wearing clothes?!
Azuki
Aw come on! It's frickin' hot in here! And we got one more body giving off heat now!
Kanna
Geez.

Why do I even bother?
Kanna
Are you sure it's okay that I'm the only one sleeping in the car?
Sumomo
Yeah, like I said, us girls gotta stick together. Don't sweat it.
Azuki
What, you wanna sleep together with us?
Sumomo
You wanna sleep between us? There's enough space.
Kanna
...Good night.
Sumomo
Ahahah!

I hurry into the car and shut the door behind me.

I can still hear the two of them talking loudly outside.

This is a special summer vacation for me.

And thankfully, the first day so far has been amazing.

Only ten more days until we get the starter for Hachimaru.

Until then, I have to narrow down those locations.

If possible, all the way down to just one, so we can set off there by the 26th.

One or two days may not mean much when it comes to how bright Halley's Comet will be.

But the day that the comet comes closest to Earth...

I feel like that'll be the day I feel the closest to a whole different world outside this planet.

The closest to Mom I'll ever be...

I need to make this chance count.
Sumomo
Aaaargh! I can't take it!
Sumomo
Azuki! Get off! Your legs are heavy! And you stink! When was the last time you took a bath?!
Azuki
*Snore* Snore*
Sumomo
OMG, get UP!
Kanna
...

Sumomo's loud voice rouses me from sleep.
Sumomo
Kanna, are you awake?

I push myself up on my elbows.
Kanna
What's wrong?
Sumomo
Sleeping next to Azuki is the worst! I can't get a wink like this. Can I sleep here?
Kanna
Huh? Where?
Sumomo
There.

She points to the camp bed I'm lying on.
Kanna
No way!
Sumomo
But I'm gonna go without sleep all night! My skin's gonna be ruined! I'll get bags under my eyes! No! I am NOT letting that happen!
Kanna
Uhhh...
Sumomo
I'll be good... for now! What's the big deal?

Sumomo skips into the car and puts her hand on the ladder.
Kanna
W-W-Wait! Okay! I get it!
Sumomo
...
Kanna
Let me get down, geez.
Azuki
*Snore* Who you callin' hag... I've not hit no fuckin' menopause...
Sumomo
She doesn't shut up, she tosses and turns all over, and she stinks!
Kanna
She'd be upset to hear that, so you better not say it to her face.

Stealthily, so as not to wake Azuki, I take a sleeping bag from the camping equipment shelf.
Sumomo
Ah, you're lending me the sleeping bag? Thanks!
Kanna
It's for me. You sleep on the bed.
Sumomo
Badump!
Kanna
...What?
Sumomo
You're so kind!
Kanna
I can't let a woman sleep on the floor, that's all.
Sumomo
Thanks. I love you. Love you sooo much.
Kanna
...

I'm sure she's just quick to get chummy with people like that.

Yeah, that must be it.
Sumomo
Where are you sleeping?
Kanna
Somewhere around here.
Sumomo
Whaat? But Azuki's too noisy. Let's sleep inside the car together. Her snoring and sleep talking are a double whammy, you know?
Kanna
...

I look down at Azuki.
Azuki
...Don't forget to subscribe... And smash that like button... *Snore*
Kanna
What's she talking about?
Sumomo
Dunno. It's a mystery.
Kanna
...

I never really noticed because I'm always sleeping in the car, but she really is damn loud.
Sumomo
Come on, let's sleep together inside, okay?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Kanna, I'm sweepy!
Kanna
Okay, okay.
Sumomo
Whoa, it feels like a super secret base.

I roll out a sleeping bag on the hard floor and lie down on it.
Sumomo
Thanks for letting me in. You sure you can sleep there?
Kanna
I'll be fine.
Sumomo
Isn't the floor hard? If you can't sleep, I don't mind you joining me up here.
Kanna
I'm fine, really.
Sumomo
And if I snore, be nice and pretend you didn't hear.
Kanna
Sure. Good night.
Sumomo
We're going to go take photographs at the terminal tomorrow, remember?
Kanna
Yeah, I know.
Sumomo
I can't wait! This might be the most fun I've ever had in my life!
Sumomo
Thank you. I really mean it.
Kanna
...

Yeah.

I think I'm also having a lot of fun spending time together with the two of them, even if it's a little overwhelming at times.

But there's no way I'm gonna tell her that.

Next morning...

Azuki finally manages to wake up just as Sumomo and I are dressed and about to leave.
Azuki
Huh? Why is Peach here?
Azuki
Oh, right. She's sleeping here now, yeah. You're up early.
Sumomo
Azuki, it was kinda crappy how you asked me to stay on my side and then punched and kicked me off the sofa. And don't get me started on your snoring!
Azuki
...
Azuki
You sleep talking, Peach? I've always slept like a baby. You sure you weren't dreaming about me kicking your ass or something?
Sumomo
Is she for real?
Azuki
Candy, where are the bananas?
Sumomo
I bought breakfast yesterday at the convenience store. Feel free to eat.
Azuki
Oh, thanks for that.
Sumomo
There's no bananas, though.
Azuki
Why not?! Scrap hunters need their daily banana intake!
Sumomo
I don't even.
Kanna
We're going out, can you take care of the car on your own?
Azuki
Oh, yeah. I'll be done with the chassis today. After that we just need to wait for the starter.
Kanna
Got it. Thanks.
Azuki
This is nothing. A seasoned scrap hunter like me can do it with her eyes closed.
Azuki
Go and have a good time, will you?
Sumomo
How cool!
Kanna
We'll be back by evening.
Azuki
Gotcha.
Sumomo
Whoa, this is already bringing back memories. We walked through here together back in the old times, right?
Kanna
Yeah. It's summer break now, but there may still be some undergrads around. Let's hurry inside.
Sumomo
Okie dokie!
Sumomo
This is such a nice place. It's so cool and comfortable, and there's no people around.
Kanna
It really is pretty cool in here, huh?

Maybe it's the proximity to the water and greenery?

Now that I think about it, I don't tend to get sweaty while I'm here.
Sumomo
Out you come.
Kanna
You put in the battery, right?
Sumomo
Yep! What should I photograph? What do you think?
Kanna
Take pictures of whatever you like.
Sumomo
What do these buttons do?
Kanna
Let me see.
Kanna
So if you push this here to the right...
Sumomo
It does the big zoom!
Kanna
But try to keep it on the left, okay?
Kanna
I think you should stick with the auto mode at first.
Sumomo
Got it!
Sumomo
Any other tips?
Kanna
Mmh, I don't think you need to worry too much, but if you really want advice...

I set up the LCD screen on her camera to display a 3x3 grid.
Kanna
If you're not sure how to photograph something, try to align the horizon with this line here, and position your subject where these two lines meet.

As a test, I line up the car in front of us at the intersection of the upper left grid and press the shutter.
Kanna
People say it's a composition that can help anchor the viewer.
Sumomo
Oooh! I didn't know there were rules like that!
Kanna
I wouldn't say it's a super strict like a rule or anything.
Kanna
Try to think of it more as a guideline to follow when you're not sure what to do. Professionals often break away from those foundations depending on what they wanna do.
Sumomo
But it looks pretty simple. I'll give it a try.
Kanna
Go for it.

For a while, we go our separate ways in the vast airport and photograph whatever takes our fancy.
Sumomo
Kanna!

Sumomo calls out to me from a distance, and I look up from the viewfinder.

She comes running my way with the brightest smile I've ever seen.
Sumomo
Look at this!
Kanna
Hm?

She shows me the LCD screen of her camera, and I see myself from the back holding up my camera on the wide runway.

The horizon line is running across the bottom third of the grid, just like I showed her, and my figure overlaps the intersection of grid lines on the right side.
Kanna
That's nice. They look really good.
Sumomo
Yeah! I suddenly don't feel like such a greenhorn!
Sumomo
You're a genius! You're a great teacher!
Kanna
This is just basic stuff. Any book on composition can teach you the same in the first few pages.

I say, with a wry smile on my face.
Kanna
But the left side on this picture is looking a little barren. See how I'm on the right side?
Sumomo
Uh-huh.
Kanna
But I'm facing to the right, see? And the rest of the picture is on the other side. Doesn't it feel kind of oppressive?
Sumomo
Hmm... Now that you mention it, I kind of see it?
Kanna
People tend to unconsciously follow the line of view of the subject in a photo. To make that visual transition smoother...
Kanna
If I'm facing to the right, maybe you situate me at the left of the picture.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
I'm not saying this is bad. This way you don't know what's beyond my line of sight, and it gives it a sense of mystery.
Sumomo
You think about all this while you're taking pictures?
Sumomo
Isn't that, like, super incredible?
Kanna
No, uh, it's really nothing.
Sumomo
No, it's incredible! It's so cool! Teach me more!
Kanna
...Sheesh, okay.

Struggling to stop the corners of my mouth from turning up, I tell her about what I know of photography.
Sumomo
Amazing! I've never been this far in!
Kanna
Me neither.

As I explain the basics of composition to her, we head deeper into the airport site.

We enter the ruins of the terminal and go up the stairs, where we come out into an open space with a panoramic view of the whole area.
Sumomo
Hey, Kanna! Snap some pics!
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
Take pictures of me. I mean, we're here alone and all.
Kanna
Oh, sure.

Sumomo smiles and strikes a modest pose.
Kanna
Oh, that's good.
Sumomo
Am I cute?
Kanna
Yeah, crazy cute.
Sumomo
Do I look stylish?
Kanna
Out of this world.
Sumomo
Ahahah!

I don't miss a single chance to photograph her bright smile.
Kanna
Yes! That smile is the cutest ever.
Kanna
It's the best. Give me more! More!
Sumomo
Who even are you right now?! Ahahah!

She keeps laughing.

It makes me smile as well.
Sumomo
Am I in the middle of the grid lines?
Kanna
Doesn't matter. You're too pretty for that.
Sumomo
Badump!
Kanna
Yes, that's really good.
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're just the best. You little lady killer!
Kanna
Yeah, sure, keep it coming.
Sumomo
Whoa, you talking back now?! You're a different person when you're behind that camera! No fair!
Sumomo
Did you get lots of pretty pictures?
Kanna
Yeah, for sure.
Sumomo
Am I that good of a subject?
Kanna
Huh? Y-Yeah.
Sumomo
I see. So you go back to normal when you put down the camera. How curious.

I notice the time stamp on the pictures as I check them over on my camera's display.
Kanna
It's about time for lunch. Let's go grab a bite then head to the library.
Sumomo
Yeah! I had so much fun! Let's go take pictures together again soon!
Kanna
Yeah. That's why we're going to the library—to find our next location.
Sumomo
Oh, yeah!

After sharing lunch, we go to the library.

Just like yesterday, I continue working my way down my list while Sumomo reads more magazine articles.

I get the feeling she's taking it a little more seriously today. Maybe getting some experience with a camera had an effect on her.

Strangely enough, it makes me happy that she's showing an interest in photography.

Blacking out possibilities from the list feels fulfilling in its own way.

At this rate, I'll easily be finished by the time the starter arrives.

Maybe we could even visit one of the nearby possible sites for a trial run while we're waiting.
Sumomo
Ah...

I mutter as I stare at the cover of the magazine Sumomo has in her hands.
Kanna
What's wrong?

Sumomo raises her face and gingerly holds up the cover for me to take a better look.

One of the headers on it reads "Anna Amei Memorial."

I give her a small nod.
Kanna
There were many of those when it happened.
Sumomo
Mind if I read it?

I nod.
Kanna
Go ahead.

Sumomo flips through the pages, her gaze intent.
Sumomo
Ava...lanche?
Kanna
An avalanche. It happened last January. Mom went to do a job in the Northern Alps and was caught up in an avalanche.
Sumomo
I see.
Kanna
It's a danger that's always there, no matter how experienced of a mountaineer you are. I read that you can minimize the risk, but it's never zero.

Sumomo nods along as I speak.
Sumomo
...I wish I could have met her.
Kanna
Yeah, I'm sure she would have loved you girls. Maybe you'd have got along even better with her than I did.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Maybe!

I keep staring at magazine in her hands.

Almost twenty nationally renowned photographers sent memorial comments, and they were all printed in a special spread in the magazine.
Kanna
Mom knew her job wasn't always the safest, but she loved it, and she always did what she felt was right.
Sumomo
Mhm.
Kanna
I'm sure she liked her life, even if it ended a little sooner than she hoped.
Sumomo
Yeah, I think the same.

I raise my face and look back at Sumomo.
Sumomo
She looked really happy in that picture you keep in your living room. I think she was super happy too.

I give her a silent nod.
Kanna
If she had one regret, it would be—

As I murmur, Sumomo smiles fearlessly and points her finger to the ceiling.
Sumomo
Halley's Comet!

I break into laughter at her.

Sumomo giggles too.
Sumomo
I remembered this time!
Kanna
That's right.
Sumomo
Okay! Operation Finding Anna is on!

She drops her gaze back to the magazine.
Kanna
We're not really looking for her, though.

I mutter to myself, feeling a wry smile forming on my face.

As the sun sets, we leave the library.
Sumomo
You think Azuki's done working on the car by now?
Kanna
Beats me. She did say that she'd be done with it today.
Sumomo
You think she would come help us at the library?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Yeah, fat chance.

I nod, and we laugh together as we walk home.

When we arrive at the garage, we find Azuki sitting on the sofa, eating bananas and flipping through a motorcycle magazine.
Sumomo
The scrap hunter is demolishing a banana.
Azuki
Nguh... The diet of a scrap hunter consists of bananas and porridge!
Sumomo
Porridge? What's that?
Azuki
My specialty, is what it is.
Sumomo
Hmm.
Kanna
What're you reading?
Azuki
A bike magazine. I'm looking to see if there're any second hand ones out there.
Sumomo
Huh? Scrap hunters buy their bikes? You don't steal them?
Azuki
Stealing stuff from people is a crime, you dummy.
Kanna
Really now...
Azuki
Scrap hunters negotiate a price both parties are happy with and strike a deal!
Sumomo
That sounds more like a used car hunter to me.
Azuki
Stop that right now! What I do is hunt for usable parts among the scrap!
Sumomo
So you're a used car hunter that moonlights as a scrap hunter.
Azuki
Stop trying to change my damn title! I can call myself whatever I want! And I'm a scrap hunter!
Azuki
Hunting for used cars is pretty much the same as looking for scrap.
Sumomo
Then how about scrappy used car hunter?
Azuki
Leave me alone! God, you're annoying!
Kanna
Is Hachimaru fixed up?
Azuki
Do you really need to ask?! I'm looking for my next prey because this one's fixed up already! Need I remind you who squished my bike and made a pancake outta it?!
Kanna
That means...
Azuki
We're just waiting for the starter. It'll probably work. The cars from this era were all pretty simple.
Azuki
You focus on deciding where we gotta go. Do you know where that sketch is supposed to be yet?

I shake my head.
Kanna
Not yet. But I will by the time the starter gets here.
Azuki
Good to hear.
Sumomo
So what're you gonna do from tomorrow, Azuki? Loaf around under the sun?
Azuki
Do I look like a stray cat to you? I'm not just gonna lounge around doing nothing all day.
Azuki
I'm pretty busy, I'll have you know! I have a lot of stuff going on.
Sumomo
You do? Like what?
Azuki
A lot of stuff! Important stuff!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're totally doing nothing.
Azuki
Aaagh, shut up!

We chow down on the cup noodles Sumumo bought yesterday and relax together.

I'm almost halfway through my list by now.
Azuki
Ooh, there's a Clubman out there. Maybe something a little smaller wouldn't be so bad for my next bike.
Azuki
Oh, lookie here. It's a sexy Zetsu. It looks really slick. Maybe something bigger instead would be better.

Azuki peruses the used motorcycles in the magazine's ad section.
Kanna
You really like bikes, huh?
Azuki
Hm? I do like myself a good bike. They're like a trusty partner.
Azuki
And not just bikes, I love all old vehicles. Our little Hachimaru has me head over heels. I want it. Gimme.
Kanna
No.
Azuki
Knew you'd say that.
Kanna
So how long have you been into cars and stuff?
Azuki
Ever since I was a little kid. Instead of dolls, I collected those miniature cars that were supposed to be for boys.
Kanna
So you've liked them for a long time, huh? Why?
Azuki
Why, you ask? I just like what I like, man. I like them because... I like them?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Hey, hey, Kanna?
Kanna
Mhm?

Sumomo directs a sweet smile at me, her hands clasped behind her back.
Kanna
What is it?
Sumomo
Where's your bath?
Kanna
Bath?

She nods.
Sumomo
Yep.
Kanna
...There isn't one.
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
Do you see any around here?
Sumomo
I'd be fine washing myself inside the camper, or just taking a shower or something.
Kanna
There's no running water in here.
Sumomo
Huh? Wait, what?
Sumomo
What are you doing about baths?!
Kanna
I just wash myself outside with the hose when the sun comes up.
Sumomo
...I don't think I can follow that example.
Sumomo
What about you, Azuki?
Azuki
Huh? I haven't taken a bath.
Sumomo
Excuse me?

Sumomo's mouth is stuck half open at that statement.

Her eyes kind of glaze over.
Azuki
It's not like skipping out on bathing is gonna kill me or anything.
Sumomo
...

Sumomo takes a deep breath, her eyes wide open in sheer shock.
Sumomo
DISGUSTING!
Azuki
Huh?! What the hell? Who you calling disgusting?!
Sumomo
You're disgusting! I can't believe you! That's why you stink so bad!
Azuki
That hurts! I know I'm cool, but I'm not made out of stone! You bully!
Sumomo
Yeah, you're not made out of stone, you're covered in freaking dirt! Have some respect for yourself!
Sumomo
Why the hell are you okay with this?! It's the middle of summer! We have no AC here! You okay in the head? Are you trying to kill yourself?!
Azuki
No, but I'm gonna kill you!
Sumomo
Kanna, make a bath! Azuki's gonna lose her humanity if she doesn't scrub the dirt off her butt!
Azuki
I don't need your stupid concern! I was about to take a bath on my own! You idiot! Stupid! You huge bitch!
Sumomo
Look! See what I mean?! If she doesn't get a bath soon, she's gonna lose the sliver of dignity she has left as a woman!
Azuki
I'll! Make! It! Myself! I just didn't take a bath because I wanted to make it myself!
Azuki
And I do have my dignity as a lady! I have it in spades!
Sumomo
Agh! You're filthy, get away from me! Take a bath first! Go on and make the damn thing!
Azuki
I'll remember this, you bitch!
Kanna
Why is this happening? What am I even doing?

I stare at the roaring flames in front of me.

I'm in charge of making sure the fire doesn't die out.
Sumomo
This feels so good! Thanks, Kanna.
Kanna
...

My face feels hot because of the fire, not because of anything else. Definitely not.
Azuki
This ain't half bad, I reckon.
Sumomo
Right? It's just unthinkable for women to go without baths for so long. You better learn from this.
Azuki
I was about to take a bath! Just today I was thinking about how I wanted to take one!
Sumomo
Ahahah!

When she laughs, a little drop of warm water flies off her and lands right onto my nose.
Sumomo
If this was just a little bit bigger you could join us in here.
Kanna
I'm fine...
Sumomo
Ahahah, you're so shy. What a cutie.
Azuki
Oh, poor Candy! The bitch's going down on you hard now.
Sumomo
I'm not! I swear, you've gotta get your head out of the gutter!
Azuki
Wh-What part of what I said was dirty?!
Sumomo
Going down on men is super dirty.
Azuki
I think you're the dirty one for taking it that way!
Sumomo
Whoa, you're totally the type to give bad head. I bet you get shy and don't put any effort in. That's a surefire way to get men to cheat on you.
Azuki
Nuh-huh! I ain't ever been cheated on!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You just haven't realized it.
Azuki
Stop talking shit!
Sumomo
It's not! I'm talking from experience.
Azuki
Thanks, I didn't need all that info!
Kanna
...

I don't wanna hear any of this.

This girl talk is nothing like what I imagined.
Azuki
You get cheated on because you look so easy. No guy would cheat on me. I'm a scrap hunter!
Sumomo
Nah, girl. All men are like that.
Azuki
The man I choose will be different!
Sumomo
You a virgin or something?
Azuki
No! Stop talking out of your ass! I'll be thirty this year!
Sumomo
Now that's funny! What kind of guys have you dated then?
Kanna
I'm going back to the garage.
Sumomo
Ah, thanks! I'll watch the fire when it's your turn to take a bath.
Kanna
I'll just wash myself with cold water later.
Sumomo
He's getting shy! C-U-T-E!
Azuki
Hey, why do you think I'm gonna get cheated on?! Come on, spit it! Hey! Answer me! Bitch! Face this way!
Azuki
Hey! You damn bitch! Come back here! I'm not done with you!
Sumomo
Phew! I'm reborn! Thanks, Kanna. Now Azuki doesn't stink.
Azuki
I don't! And I never did!
Sumomo
You wanna take a bath? I can watch the fire for you.
Kanna
I'm good. I'll wash tomorrow morning.

I'm comparing my list with the guidebooks of the Tohoku region I borrowed from the library.

Sumomo comes closer to me.

She smells kind of like peaches after her bath.
Sumomo
Hey, so I was talking with Azuki just now.
Kanna
Hm?
Sumomo
You know about the, uh, starter thingie? Azuki won't have much to do until it gets here either, right?
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
Why don't we go camping somewhere nearby? We still have a lot of time until Halley's Comet day, right?
Sumomo
It'll be like a rehearsal for the big day! And Azuki doesn't stink anymore, so it'll be fine!
Azuki
I never stank! God, will you ever drop it?!
Kanna
But we don't have a car?
Sumomo
Eh? But isn't this pretty much the sticks? Aren't there campsites around?
Kanna
Not that we can walk to, no.

But even as I say it, I have an idea.

One particular place I visited with Mom and Dad comes to mind.
Kanna
We could take the bus, though.
Sumomo
Really?! We can go? Let's do it!
Azuki
Why the heck are you so pumped about all this?
Sumomo
Because I was pumped for a summer treasure hunt, but we've done nothing but read in the library all day! The routine's getting old!
Kanna
I know how you feel, but still...
Azuki
Will you have enough time to scout out the place, Candy? You still gotta pin down where it might be, right?
Kanna
Well, I should have plenty of time.
Sumomo
Yes! Let's go!

I look at the camping equipment sitting in the corner of the garage.

Besides the sleeping bag I grabbed yesterday, none of the tools have seen much use as of late.

We used them every month back when Mom was alive.

All the gear looks kind of lonely now, sitting there gathering dust.
Kanna
I'll look up campsites around here tomorrow.
Kanna
I'll try to pick the place most likely to have the spot we're looking for, if that's okay.
Sumomo
Yeah, yeah! The place doesn't matter! I just wanna camp together! The three of us!
Azuki
Heh, how bad can it be? So when are we leaving? Tomorrow?
Kanna
We gotta ride the bus, so let's go the morning of the day after tomorrow. It's pretty late today, and we gotta spend tomorrow preparing.
Azuki
Copy that.
Sumomo
Ditto!
Kanna
Shouldn't you be getting ready? I can do this on my own.
Sumomo
Don't you worry! I'm researching about camping!
Sumomo
I'm ready to tackle outdoor cooking! I like, totally know how to boil water!
Kanna
All right. Let's try to wrap things up here early.

She gives me an enthusiastic nod.

There are three campsites within twenty kilometers of home.

One of them is in the mountains, and is actually pretty family friendly. This is the only one of the campsites you can catch a bus to from in front of Nariyama Academy.

The other two are on open plains, so there's no chance the sketch is from either of them.
Kanna
I think this place will do.
Sumomo
Oh? Where? Where?

I  push the guide to the campsite over to her.
Sumomo
Ooh! There's cows! They also sell ice cream! This looks good! I love it!
Kanna
It's also kind of a candidate for the spot we're looking for. I often visited with my parents, and I kind of remember a cavern where you can look up at the sky.
Sumomo
Amazeballs! We could hit the jackpot before the car is even repaired!
Kanna
I doubt we'll be that lucky.

But I suppose there's a chance.
Sumomo
So now we've decided on the spot, can we go back?
Kanna
I'd like to look up a few more places, if you don't mind.
Sumomo
Sure thing, go for it! Ever since you taught me how to take pictures, it's even more fun to read camera magazines!

I've managed to narrow down the possible locations in the Tohoku and Kanto regions to just eight.

Now I just have to do the same with the western Nariyama area.

And finally, I'll use the car to visit each location and look for a place where I can take the picture that the sketch illustrates.

And if I can't find it after all this work, then I guess I can say I tried.

At the very least, I will have done everything I possibly could.
Sumomo
Hey, hey, Kanna. Look at this.
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
It says this is Amei Anna's successor. Isn't this person about the same age as you?
Kanna
My mom's successor?

The title of the article reads "The Next Amei Anna" in big, bold letters.
Sumomo
It says they go around on their motorcycle taking pictures of the sky.
Sumomo
Kinda sounds like Azuki, huh?
Kanna
...Lemme see that.

I take the magazine from her.

Rising star of the industry. "Young nature photographer."
Kanna
Takuma?
Sumomo
The guy who had a comment in that memorial article? Do you know him?
Kanna
I don't.

The next Amei Anna?

How dare they use my mom's name to introduce this fucker?

I turn the page, hate and frustration beginning to tense my muscles.
Sumomo
They take really beautiful pictures, huh?

It's a two-page spread of the starry sky.

...It really is a beautiful photo.
Kanna
Looks like they have good equipment. Must be some rich kid.

I mutter under my breath while checking the lens details in the corner of the page.

F2.8 aperture, 16-35mm zoom.

Ultra wide-angle zoom lens, then.
Kanna
...

I could take a picture like this if I had that kind of equipment, no problem.
Sumomo
Kanna? Is something wrong?
Kanna
...No.
Sumomo
Really?
Kanna
...

What the hell is that crap about them being the second coming of my mom?

Who uses the name of a dead person without permission like that?!

The magazine is probably just trying to hype this loser up.

God forbid the guy is going around calling himself my mom's successor.
Sumomo
Kanna! Wait up!
Sumomo
What's wrong? Are you jealous another guy your age is doing well as a photographer?
Kanna
No, I'm not!
Sumomo
You're totes jealous.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I'm sorry! I didn't show you that to make you feel bad. I just thought maybe you knew them since they're using Anna's name and all.
Kanna
Well, I don't know that guy, okay?!

It surprises me how loud my voice comes out.

And from the way her eyes widen, it looks like I scared Sumomo, too.
Sumomo
S-Sorry, okay? Did I say something bad?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
You both take beautiful pictures, as far as I can see. I don't really understand why you'd be mad.

No. That's not it.

Maybe it's the amount of pictures and different scenery I saw.

I also read the article.

It said that he couldn't make it in school, so he worked to get a motorcycle license and now travels all over Japan.

I know what it's like.

That's why I've been trying to do the same.

If you really wanna get serious about photography, then you don't have time for anything else.

The world won't wait for you.

That's what I wanted to do.

And I was right in the end.
Sumomo
Turn that frown upside down!
Sumomo
We're all going camping together tomorrow, remember?
Sumomo
Then you can go and take pictures just as beautiful as those ones! It'll be fine!
Kanna
...

Sighing, I pull myself together.

I'm being such a brat right now.

I shouldn't lash out at Sumomo just because I feel defeated.

I know that.
Kanna
Sorry for yelling at you.
Sumomo
Oh, don't worry.
Sumomo
It'll be fine. You enjoy taking pictures like nothing else, and that, uh, Takuma was it? He also likes photography, right?
Sumomo
You're gonna become a photographer, so maybe you can make friends with him along the way.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Mm?

Sumomo...

She treats me becoming a photographer like a fact set in stone.

She probably believes it more than I do.
Kanna
Sumomo.
Sumomo
Yes?
Kanna
You think I can become a photographer?
Sumomo
Huh?

She tilts her head to the side in confusion.
Sumomo
You don't want to? You said you want to. Uh, what do you mean? Is there some reason you can't?
Kanna
...

I smile despite myself.

I guess she's right.

Sumomo calls herself stupid all the time.

But she may be the best person I know at finding the most obvious, straightforward route that most others would overlook.

I can see that now.
Sumomo
Mm? Kanna?
Kanna
Err, it's nothing, really.
Kanna
...Thanks.
Sumomo
Huh? You're welcome?
Kanna
You two have your luggage ready?
Sumomo
Wait, are you serious? We have to carry all this stuff?
Sumomo
This is, kind of, more than I expected, to be honest.
Azuki
This whole thing was your idea, girl. No backing out now.
Kanna
You should be grateful it's a campsite where we can rent tents and chairs. This gear is the bare minimum.
Sumomo
For real? Camping is this hardcore?
Sumomo
I thought it was all about enjoying nature, eating tasty meat, and drinking hot coffee.
Azuki
And all the time before and after that is spent setting up and then taking stuff down.

I nod.
Sumomo
And that's supposed to be fun?!
Azuki&Kanna
Sure is.
Sumomo
Hah, if you say so. Oh well, I'll just see it as burning calories and push through.
Kanna
I'm pretty sure your luggage is the lightest, though.
Sumomo
Thanks, Kanna. I can feel your love. All right! I'm gonna do my best to get to the bus stop in one piece!
Azuki
Man, Granny Peach can't carry her stuff, eh?
Sumomo
Yeah, go off. It's too heavy.
Sumomo
Finally! My kingdom for a seat! I'm gonna die. Kanna, gimme a shoulder rub, please! Massage me till we're there.
Kanna
Hell no. It wasn't that bad, and you were carrying less than all of us.
Sumomo
I walked for fifteen whole minutes! I have more boobage weighing me down than you! Did you factor that in when you weighed the stuff?!
Kanna
How could I even?
Sumomo
They're heavy! It doesn't show because I'm small, but they're huge!
Kanna
I do realize that...
Sumomo
Ughhh, I'm beat. But it's so fun! But I'm so pooped! What I wouldn't give for a cold one right now.
Kanna
It'll taste even better after we're all set up, so hang in there.
Sumomo
I. Will. Try.

Only ten minutes after boarding the bus, Sumomo makes a full recovery.
Sumomo
Whoa, Nariyama's pretty damn beautiful, huh? It's incredible. Nothing but mountains!
Kanna
I thought you lived around here?
Sumomo
Nowhere near. I go to a uni back in Tokyo. One bad enough to accept a birdbrain like me.
Kanna
Oh, so why did you come here?
Sumomo
So I was, like, gonna do my teaching training in my alma mater, you know? Is that how you say it? But they kinda played hot potato with me before sending me to this academy out in the sticks.
Azuki
They sure made you someone else's problem, huh?
Sumomo
Ahahah, that they did.
Kanna
So you're going back to Tokyo?
Sumomo
Yeah. Guess I gotta start learning again when the new semester starts.
Sumomo
I've been toying with the idea of not forcing myself back into that mess, though.
Azuki
Give it up already. You won't learn anything useful about real life just by doing what you're told in some stuffy college.
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're right about that.
Azuki
All the knowledge you need to live is out in the scrap field.
Sumomo
And where the heck is that?! Are you sure you don't mean the garbage dump? You smelly butt!
Azuki
Shut up, will you?! The scrap field is sacred!
Kanna
...

Doing what you're told, huh?

Can I really find some point in going back to the academy for the second semester?
Azuki
Ah, there goes a Wolksvagen Bus. Look at it go.
Sumomo
What bus?
Azuki
That yellow, round-looking one.
Sumomo
Ooh, it's so cute.
Azuki
Good taste.
Sumomo
And what's that one over there? It looks pretty old.
Azuki
That's a Bolbo. They're the company that made the three-point safety belt and was nice enough to release the patent to the public. Cool, ain't it?
Sumomo
Oooh! You really love cars, huh?
Azuki
Yeah. I mean, they really are damn cool. Right, Candy?
Kanna
Huh? Oh, yeah. I guess?
Azuki
What's with that answer? Don't you like cars? Isn't that Hachimaru important to you?
Kanna
I guess it's because it's my mom's car. I'm sure I'll end up liking it even more if I learn to tinker with it myself, like you do.
Azuki
Mm, gotcha.
Sumomo
We're heeere! I'm so moved that the bus driver was nice enough to drive us all the way to the entrance!
Kanna
Really? You're not moved by the scenery?
Sumomo
It's hard to appreciate the scenery when you're dead tired.
Azuki
The slacker has a point.
Sumomo
Don't we need to talk to a receptionist or something?
Kanna
Yeah. It's not that expensive, but we do have to pay.
Sumomo
Okay! Azuki, you got the dosh?
Azuki
I have enough! Thank you very much!
Sumomo
Yaaay! The tents are already set up! And there's chairs! Easy-peasy!
Azuki
Why the heck did you even wanna come camping?
Sumomo
I wanted us to spend time and talk together somewhere spacious and freeing!
Azuki
Hmm, but Candy's garage isn't that bad, is it?
Sumomo
Well, no, but that's kind of our base of operations.
Sumomo
Don't you sometimes, like, want a change of scenery? To clear your head?
Kanna
It's only been two days since you moved into the garage, if I remember correctly.
Azuki
She just gets bored easily, that's what it is. You gotta rein that in a little, Peach.
Sumomo
I'm just genuine! More genuine than most pretty girls out there.

I prepare my mom's ultra wide-angle lens that I brought from home and hang the single-lens reflex camera around my neck.
Kanna
Okay, I'm ready.
Sumomo
Oh, what's that big thing?
Kanna
A lens to photograph the stars.
Sumomo
Ooh! Bringing out the big guns!
Kanna
I'm gonna show the sketch to the people in the lobby to see if they recognize the place.
Kanna
I wanna start searching before it gets dark.
Sumomo
Let me come too! I brought my camera and all!

She excitedly pulls the pink camera out of her bag.
Sumomo
Can you stay with the tents, Azuki?
Azuki
Sure. Taking it easy is more my thing anyway. You two be careful.
Sumomo
Thanks! Let's go!
Sumomo
Look, there's a staff member over there. Let's ask them.

I nod, and we walk up to the member of staff by the reception.

The white-haired, amicable old man at the reception stares at the sketch for a while.
Reception Old Man
Mmh, what might this be? Conifers, maybe? I've half a mind to say it looks like a cave.
Sumomo
Do you know of any place like this around here?
Reception Old Man
There used to be conifer forests here once upon a time. Until that thing fifteen years ago, I reckon.

What thing fifteen years ago?
Kanna
The wave eating?

The old man nods meekly.
Reception Old Man
The whole ecosystem in the area got thrown out of whack, and now it's all different. This sketch you got here must be rather old.

I nod.
Sumomo
But why? What messed up that, uh, ecosystem, was it?
Kanna
I remember hearing that the pigeons don't really affect the environment.
Reception Old Man
But there's lots of them around Nariyama, you see. And they don't eat the insects that damage the plant life, like normal birds do. They just need water and sun to go about.
Reception Old Man
And the pests end up increasing and eating the trees and flowers, you see.
Sumomo
Makes sense.
Reception Old Man
Even ancient trees like the thousand-year-old wisteria are done for, and the forests haven't fared well at all. The only thing we can grow now is corn.
Sumomo
And corn is okay to plant?
Reception Old Man
It makes money, so the company here takes care of it well enough.
Sumomo
I see.
Reception Old Man
In the ingredients we gave you earlier were some fresh-cut corn cobs from right on our doorstep. You better try 'em! Our Chiba corn is sweet and delicious, make no mistake!
Kanna
So... There isn't a place that looks like this nearby anymore?
Reception Old Man
Hmm...

The old man stares intently at the sketch again.
Reception Old Man
There's a cave just through the corn field. I reckon it might look like this if you look up at the sky from there.
Kanna
So the cave's still there?
Reception Old Man
It sure is.
Kanna
We'll take a look. Thank you.

We walk through the cornfield in the direction the old man showed us.

This place isn't far from Nariyama city, yet the climate here is much nicer.
Sumomo
Whoa, this field sure is huge! We should bring Azuki here later.

Sumomo snaps a picture of the cornfield as it spreads out before us.
Sumomo
Can you walk on ahead?
Kanna
Why?
Sumomo
I wanna take a picture of you from the back. Imagine it! The lone boy walking through the cornfield under the setting sun. Sounds kinda melancholy, no?
Kanna
Let's do that later. I wanna see the cave.
Sumomo
Aww, but we're here now!
Kanna
...

I look up at the sky.

It's a little cloudy today.
Kanna
I just want to get this out of the way first.
Kanna
I think it's that way. Come on.
Sumomo
Oookay!
Sumomo
Huh? Where's the cave? Is that it?

We come to a small hole that looks like an adult person would just barely be able to squeeze through.
Sumomo
Isn't the entrance a little small to call it a cave? It looks like we could get in, but would we be able to get out again?

I feel like I remember this place.

But...
Kanna
I remember this being way bigger.
Sumomo
Maybe because you were smaller back then?
Kanna
But I remember going in with my mom, so it'll probably be okay.
Sumomo
Really now...
Kanna
I'll go in first.
Sumomo
Be careful, okay?

The entrance is narrow at first before opening up into a spacious cave.
Kanna
It looks okay. It's pretty big inside.
Sumomo
Really? Can I fit in too?
Kanna
Yeah, you should be fine. I can see light up ahead, too.
Sumomo
Okay, I'm coming in.

When she pops her head in, our eyes meet.

I reach out, take her hand, and help Sumomo through the narrow entrance.
Sumomo
I'm in!

She keeps her hand in mine.
Sumomo
It's dark, so can we keep holding hands?
Kanna
Sure...
Sumomo
You wanna go towards the light?
Kanna
Yeah.

Hand in hand, we slowly make our way forward.
Kanna
Whoa...
Sumomo
Whoa indeed!

Up ahead is a small patch of yellow flowers.
Sumomo
They're so cute. What kind of flowers do you think they are?

Sumomo asks me as she leans over the flowers to take pictures.

I stand in the center of the flowerbed and look up.
Kanna
...

There's a view of the sky from here, yeah.

I can see a sliver of the sunset sky peeking through the small, round hole above.

But...

It's not right.

The shape is completely different.
Kanna
This isn't the place.
Sumomo
Hm?
Kanna
This isn't it. We probably can't see the comet from here.
Kanna
It's not a cave. Maybe it's a conifer forest like the old man said.
Sumomo
Oh, I see.
Kanna
...

The man also said that all the conifer forests around here were destroyed because of the pigeons.

This means that if the location still exists as it did back then, it's definitely not in Nariyama.

And if it was here, the place the sketch depicts is already long gone.

I heave a sad sigh.
Sumomo
But I think this place is beautiful, too.
Sumomo
Let's take some pictures while we're here.
Kanna
...

She's right. This is the only place where you can take a picture of the sky like this.

And...

I open the ultra wide-angle lens case I've been carrying.

I brought it all this way.

Might as well take some pictures.
Sumomo
What's that?
Kanna
A special lens, to take good pictures of the night sky.
Sumomo
Oooh.
Kanna
You're right. It'd be a shame not to make the most of it, now that we're here.

I align the camera with the hole overhead and click the shutter.

It's a little dark.

So I slow down the shutter speed.
Sumomo
What are you doing?
Kanna
It's a bit dark, so I'm slowing down the shutter speed. If it stays open for longer, it'll catch more light.
Sumomo
I see.
Kanna
...

I release the shutter several times then check the screen.
Sumomo
Is it blurry?
Kanna
If you slow down the shutter speed and let the camera shake even a little while it's still open, it comes out blurry.
Sumomo
Sounds difficult. The flowers over here are pretty, too.
Kanna
Yeah, but...

I point the camera to the sky again.

After a few more tries, I manage to get a picture without blur.

But even so...

I see nothing special in the picture. This isn't going to elicit any emotions from anyone.

I let out a deep sigh.
Sumomo
What's wrong? Is it no good?
Kanna
Yeah, I guess not. It's not the right place, so it's kinda pointless.
Sumomo
But the red sky is so pretty.
Kanna
The ones of the sunset I took in the terminal were far better.
Sumomo
You really don't look like you're having fun here at all. Does that have anything to do with it?

I look up from the camera display.
Kanna
Me?
Sumomo
It looks more like you're taking an exam rather than enjoying yourself.
Sumomo
We came all the way to such a beautiful place, so maybe just try to focus on having a good time taking pictures!
Sumomo
If your memories of taking the pictures aren't fun, then what's the point of taking them at all?
Kanna
What do you mean?
Sumomo
So you know how the person that takes the picture can look at it and remember lots of stuff about it?
Sumomo
I'll remember having fun, but do you think you'd remember this moment and see something you like looking back on?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Looking for Anna's treasure spot isn't some boring test.
Sumomo
I'm sure she'd be way happier if you had fun while searching for it.
Sumomo
Right?
Kanna
...

I give her a quick, sullen nod.

We leave the cave shortly after.

This time, Sumomo is the one leading the way, holding my hand in hers.

It's already dark by the time we arrive back at the tent where Azuki's waiting for us.

We find her staring vacantly up at the starry sky, her cheeks already flushed from the alcohol.
Sumomo
Gah! Why are you drinking without me?!
Azuki
Huh? Oh! Peach! Candy!
Sumomo
Why the heck?! We promised to toast and drink together! I've been looking forward to it all day!
Azuki
Take a look at this sky, Peach. How many stars can you count?
Kanna
She's counting stars?
Sumomo
How original.
Azuki
Yeah. Compared to this mantle of stars, we're like little motes of dust.
Kanna
I know what you're trying to say, but what's gotten into you?
Sumomo
I wanna drink too! Kanna, let's grill some tasty meat!
Sumomo
This is the damn best! Nature, meat, and beer!
Kanna
I'm glad you like it.
Azuki
Yeah, nature's always best! Not like this is news to me.
Kanna
Please don't drink until you throw up this time. We only have the one tent.
Azuki
And who's gonna barf?! I'll have you know that once something goes down my hatch, it doesn't come back out! That's how I roll!
Sumomo
Ahahah! Life's always a party when Azuki's around.
Azuki
This ain't no party! I'm protesting this gross accusation!
Sumomo
Just don't overdo it. We've still gotta carry everything back tomorrow morning.
Azuki
I know already! What are you?! My damn mom?!

After grilling and devouring the food we got with the welcome package, we put the fire out and crawl into the tent.

Azuki collapses on top of her sleeping bag without even bothering to get inside of it.
Azuki
Aaah, camping's the best! I love you two! Time to sleep.
Sumomo
She's such a problem drunk every single time.

Her words are harsh, but a wry smile plays across her face.
Sumomo
You're gonna sleep like that, Azuki? How about changing clothes?
Azuki
Who cares? We're camping! We can sleep, wake up, and go home in the same clothes!
Sumomo
Guess I can cut her some slack today. I better hit the hay too.

Sumomo turns back to me.

Her peachy scent fills the narrow tent.

I'm starting to think her shampoo is particularly strong.
Sumomo
I can't sleep next to Azuki, so you go in the middle, okay?
Kanna
Why me?
Sumomo
Become my shield! Protect the precious sleep of this novice camper!
Kanna
Uhhh...

Suddenly, the memories of Azuki barfing all over me come rushing back.

I look down at her.

She's hugging her sleeping bag, seemingly already deep asleep.

Maybe it'll be okay tonight?
Sumomo
Over here! Lie down right here.

Sumomo sits on the opposite side of the tent from Azuki and taps the middle ground between them, motioning me to come over.
Sumomo
This is your special seat.
Kanna
...

I lay down on my back in between the two of them.
Sumomo
Today's been so much fun.
Kanna
...Right.
Sumomo
Did you enjoy today too?

I turn to Sumomo, so that we're facing each other.

Resting her head on her arm, she smiles at me.

I return her smile with one of my own and nod.
Sumomo
Mhm mhm, it sure was fun. I'm so glad.
Sumomo
You can totally take good pictures, I'm sure of it.
Sumomo
No need to hurry. Everything will be just fine.
Kanna
I need to hurry. Halley's Comet comes only once every 76 years.
Sumomo
But don't you think there's lots of other stuff you can photograph? Like, you know...

She stares at me with her huge, sparkling eyes.
Kanna
Like you?
Sumomo
Yep yep. Take more pictures of me! I love it when you photograph me.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
So don't worry. It'll all be fine...
Sumomo
There's no need to rush...
Sumomo
Zzz...
Kanna
Sumomo?
Sumomo
Zzz... Zzz...
Kanna
...

I get up, unzip Sumomo's sleeping bag, and gently cover her lower half with it.
Kanna
She doesn't seem so much older than me right now...
Kanna
Ouch!

Immediately after muttering that, Azuki's heel crashes down on my side.
Azuki
Who're you calling old?! *Snore*
Kanna
*Sigh*

She's an awful sleeper.

And her shirt's hiked up her stomach too.

I doubt it'll do much good, but I also cover her with the sleeping bag.

And as if on cue, she swipes it away with her feet.
Kanna
It's pretty hot, huh?
Sumomo
Zzz... Zzz...
Azuki
Zzz... *Snore*
Kanna
...

I hear Sumomo breathing softly on one side of me and Azuki snoring away on the other.

A sweet, peachy scent wafts from Sumomo.

And Azuki smells like a mix of the soap I always use and cigarettes.

The way their sleeping positions emphasize their cleavage is almost too much for me.

And then, I realize.

I won't be able to sleep a wink tonight.

There's absolutely no chance of it.
Kanna
*Sigh*

I get up and unzip the entrance to the tent.

Sumomo's words are still rattling around inside my head.

She's right.

I wasn't having fun taking pictures today. Not at all.

But why not?

What Sumomo said is really making me think.

I've never really considered how I feel while I'm photographing something.

I worked under the assumption that a professional photographer is judged purely by what can be seen in the picture.

So I focused on composition, and how to capture the light, and so on.

I didn't give much thought to anything else.

What photos have I most enjoyed taking, up until now?

Searching for the answer, I remember the times I photographed Sumomo at the terminal.

I truly enjoyed taking those, from the bottom of my heart.

I felt like I was able to bring out and capture her charm. A charm no one else knows about.

I...

Do I feel the same way about the stars?

Do I have the same conviction as my mom, that kept her waiting for Halley's Comet?

Do I love Hachimaru as strongly as Mom and Azuki?
Kanna
...

I sneak into the tent and pick up my single-lens reflex camera.

The campsite is pretty dark at night.

I can't even see my feet without a flashlight.

It really brings home how bright the city is by contrast.

Even if people say the wave eating was our fault and we should reduce our dependence on technology, the difference between wilderness and civilization is still incredible.

I see the comet trailing through the sky.

I point my camera at it.

One, twice.

I press the shutter a few times, capturing the dazzling celestial body.

There's none of the excitement I felt with her.

Heaving a sigh, I walk back to the tent.
