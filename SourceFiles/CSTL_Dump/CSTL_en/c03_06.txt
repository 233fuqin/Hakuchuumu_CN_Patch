Sumomo
Ah, good morning!
Kanna
Morning. You're up early.
Sumomo
Yeah, kind of felt like being the early bird for once.

I nod at her.

Azuki's still sleeping on the sofa.
Sumomo
Besides! We're gonna have a shoot, so I had to doll myself up for the occasion.
Kanna
You didn't need to do anything special.
Sumomo
But it's our last time, so I wanna look good!
Kanna
Mhm.
Sumomo
That photographer guy said you have potential, remember? So you'd better get a shot of Halley's Comet tonight.
Kanna
Yeah, it's just that...
Sumomo
Mm?
Kanna
He told me to take pictures of the people looking up at the comet, not the comet itself.
Sumomo
People?

I nod in response.
Kanna
He saw my photos and said I'm more cut out for taking pictures of people. Like him.
Sumomo
Mhm! I agree! I think your photographs helped me love myself better, even!
Kanna
I think you're the person I can capture best too.

Sumomo smiles at me happily.
Kanna
My new teacher told me to take pictures of people looking up at the comet today.
Sumomo
I think that's good, yeah!
Kanna
But I think my best photographs will still be the ones I take of you, so I want to show him some more of those too.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
That is, if you're okay with it.

Sumomo nods enthusiastically.
Sumomo
Oh, please do!

I nod back at her.
Sumomo
I see. So the photographs you showed him were of me?
Kanna
Yeah, they were.

I nod noncommittally.
Sumomo
Really?! My photographs kickstarted your career?! I'm so happy! So, what else did he say?!
Kanna
Err, not much.
Sumomo
Didn't he say I was cute or something?!
Kanna
I don't think I remember.
Sumomo
What the heck?!
Kanna
He said you were my best subject.
Sumomo
Ooh! What else?!
Kanna
Just that.
Sumomo
Hmph!

I don't mention that he pointed out how much I adore her.
Kanna
Where should we go?

Sumomo tilts her head in confusion.
Sumomo
Mm?
Kanna
For the shoot. It's best if it's a place you like, so you should pick.
Sumomo
Pick the place, huh? Let's see...

Sumomo looks up as she thinks it over.
Sumomo
Maybe somewhere... where we can see the whole city.
Sumomo
I really want to remember this summer and this city.

She speaks with a smile.
Kanna
Hmm, let me think.
Sumomo
Is there a place like that around?
Kanna
Nothing's coming to mind right away, but I'm sure we can find one.
Sumomo
Ahahah! More location scouting, huh?

Sumomo seems thrilled by the idea.

Her enthusiasm is infectious.
Sumomo
I love the idea! Let's search together! I bet we can find something good before lunch.
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
You told your daddy to make some time tonight?
Kanna
Yeah, I did.
Sumomo
Great. We gotta be back by tonight, then.
Kanna
If you're all ready, we could head out now.
Sumomo
Sure thing!

I'm so glad it's a sunny day.

The air is clear and fresh.

The locals aren't up and about yet, so we walk side by side through the empty streets.
Sumomo
Ah, Kanna! Look at that.

Sumomo stops and points to a narrow alley.

Just past the houses lies a dirt road, almost an animal trail, leading up a small mountain beyond.
Kanna
Think it's safe?
Sumomo
You've never been there?
Kanna
No... I don't think people live in this area anymore.

This was my usual road from home to the academy, but I stuck to it pretty rigidly.

As we approach, we notice the trail has little steps made out of small logs and flattened soil.

A man-made trail, then.
Sumomo
There's stairs, even.
Kanna
Wanna go?

Sumomo nods, her eyes shining.
Sumomo
This is an adventure! Let's go!

We climb up the crudely assembled stairs of the path.
Sumomo
Whoa! This is super!

At the end of the dimly lit trail, we come out to a quiet meadow.

It looks out over all of Nariyama city.

I've never been here before.
Sumomo
I didn't think I'd warm up to this place so much. I used to think it was such a backwater.

She smiles at me as she speaks.

I turn on my camera and hold it up.
Sumomo
Ah, you're starting already?
Kanna
Yeah, just try to be natural.
Sumomo
Agreed.

Sumomo turns her back to me and looks down at the cityscape.

I gaze at her through the viewfinder and press the shutter.

She looks back with a smile.

I frame her profile and press the shutter again.
Sumomo
Say, Kanna...

Sumomo walks at a slow pace, her hands clasped behind her.
Sumomo
I'm sure you'll be able to make lots of people happy in the future.
Sumomo
Your shoots are so much fun.
Sumomo
I bet the models'll be all over you too.
Kanna
I don't care about that.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Now that I think about it, getting to talk with you now, while you're still pure and innocent, might be something really special.
Kanna
You can also...
Sumomo
Hm?
Kanna
You can make lots of people smile too. You have that kind of power.
Kanna
Your smile can make people happy...
Kanna
...just as well as my photography.
Sumomo
You think so?
Kanna
Yeah. Sometimes I take a look at that photo of you to cheer myself up.
Sumomo
Only sometimes?!
Kanna
...Actually, it's every single day.
Sumomo
Really?!

I nod.
Sumomo
Oh, you cheeky little thing! You head over heels for me or something?
Kanna
...I am.

My response obviously takes her by surprise. She stares right at the camera, eyes wide.
Kanna
I realized I'm in love with you.
Sumomo
Can you say it one more time?

I lower the camera and look directly at her.

She returns my gaze.

There's a faint blush in her cheeks.

I can tell that my face is red and hot as well.

I go back to looking at her through the viewfinder.

Yeah, I still can't say it straight to her face...
Kanna
I think you know what I said.
Sumomo
Ahahah!

A smile of pure joy spreads across her face.
Sumomo
Sounds like we feel the same way about each other.
Kanna
It seems so.
Sumomo
Am I your first love?
Kanna
Maybe.
Sumomo
Yippee!
Sumomo
So I'm your first, huh? I'm so glad I did this teacher training thing.

Sumomo turns her gaze to the town.
Kanna
I'll get better at photography.

She turns around to face me again.
Sumomo
Yes! I know you will!
Kanna
I'll be able to teach you even more about it.
Sumomo
Yes!
Kanna
So...
Sumomo
...

She waits for me to continue.

The wind blows, stirring her hair.
Kanna
Come back and visit me sometime.

Sumomo nods.
Sumomo
I'll come anytime, if you'll be there waiting for me.

The tears welling up in my eyes make it difficult to get the image in focus.

I want to get a picture of that gentle smile.

I know this is no time to be crying.

And yet the tears don't stop.

I wipe the tears away with my hand.

Sumomo just watches, her smile unwavering.
Kanna
Sorry.

She shakes her head slowly.
Sumomo
It's okay.
Kanna
Mhm.

I take a deep breath and look through the viewfinder again.

Now that I've got her in focus, I can see she has tears in her eyes too.

But she's still smiling.

Both her smile and her tears are so undeniably Sumomo. I press the shutter again.
Sumomo
You got my good side?
Kanna
That's every side.
Sumomo
That was smooth, heheh.

She giggles at my comment.

After coming down back down from the hill, we have lunch together.

We start looking through the photos on my camera's display, reminiscing about the summer. It feels like we've only just begun when I notice that the sun is setting.

Where did all the time go?

We leave the fast food restaurant where we spent way too much time, and head back to the city.
Sumomo
You've got your homework from your teacher, right? To take pictures of people looking at Halley's Comet?
Kanna
Yeah. I was thinking about heading to the academy. I hear they opened the roof for comet-watching.

There were posters about it in the library.
Sumomo
The academy, huh? I guess it'd be awkward for me to tag along, since I'm no longer part of the faculty.
Kanna
If you have the time, we can go together. It's open to the public, so it's probably okay.
Sumomo
Do you wanna go together?
Kanna
...

After a long silence, I nod.
Sumomo
Ahahah! You've gotten a lot more upfront about what you want.
Sumomo
Then I'll come with. I wanna be with you.

There's already a crowd at the academy's entrance.

The entrance is wide open, and people are pouring in en masse.

There are all kinds of people, from really little kids to adults old enough to be parents of students.
Sumomo
Whoa, that's a lot of people.
Kanna
This only comes around once every 76 years, I guess.
Kanna
Guess this is our comet party, huh?
Sumomo
Yes! This is great!

As we enter, we find the undergraduates who sponsored the get-together guiding visitors to the elevators.

Sumomo and I follow the crowds to the rooftop.
Sumomo
Whoa, this place is packed!
Kanna
This only happens once every 76 years, so no wonder.
Sumomo
You're gonna take pics of lots of different people, right? Wanna split off?
Kanna
Huh? But...
Sumomo
This is an important job for you. Go take lots of nice photos. It's the first step towards your dream!
Sumomo
I'll be watching you kill it from the sidelines!
Kanna
Okay. I'll do it.
Sumomo
Go for it!

Kanna walks off, fiddling with the huge camera hanging from a strap around his neck.

I wonder if a big camera like that is hard to use.

Something about him seems stronger than before, more reliable.

Or maybe that's just my imagination.

I watch him strike up a conversation with a family comet-gazing together.

I wonder if he's asking for permission to take photos of them.

Yes, good. He'd never take pictures of someone without their consent. That's my boy.

He raises his camera and snaps a shot of the smiling family.

After taking a few more, he bows and thanks them.

Yes, good. It's nice to thank people properly. That's my boy.

He glances my way and waves.
Sumomo
Ahahah.

The little gesture is so sweet that it makes me laugh.

I return the wave, and then he turns away with a smile and moves on to the next person.
Sumomo
Heh... I shouldn't get in his way.

Step by step, he's getting closer to his dream.

He argued with his dad, then made up.

He found a rival and got jealous over their success, and lost his way a few times.

But I can feel he's slowly growing up into the person he wants to be.

But what about me? What should I do?

If I just while the years away...

He may be disappointed with me when we manage to meet again.

I let out a small sigh.

And that sigh...

Is matched by one from the girl sitting next to me.

When I turn to her, she looks right back at me.
Female Student
Oh?
Sumomo
Hm?

Her eyes are red and swollen.

I don't think I know her.

I'd guess she's around the same age as Kanna.

She's been staring at me, her head cocked to the side.
Sumomo
Um...
Female Student
Miss Mononouchi Sumomo? That's you, right? The teacher?
Sumomo
How do you know my full name?!

But after saying that, I realize.
Sumomo
Oh, right, you're in the same class as Kanna?
Female Student
Who's Kanna?
Sumomo
Oops, I mean Amei.

She nods.
Female Student
You came to stargaze too?
Sumomo
Yep, I did.

She looks back out at the crowd, a lonely smile on her lips.

I watch her for a moment.

Then, all of a sudden, tears well up in her eyes again.

I follow her gaze.

She's staring at a couple holding hands.

They look to be about the same age as Kanna too.

I see. I think I know what's going on here.
Sumomo
Boy trouble?
Female Student
Huh?
Sumomo
...

Turning back to me, she starts to cry in earnest.

Her eyeliner is smudged, making her look like a little like a panda.

She's also used way too much rouge and didn't blend it properly.

She must not be used to wearing makeup.

Maybe she put it on for the first time because she wanted to look pretty for the boy she likes.

Her hair is also in such a state that I'd love to have a word with her hairstylist.

She looks like a pretty ordinary girl.

She must have really mustered up all her courage for this special day.
Sumomo
It's that guy, right?

My eyes are fixed on the couple.

She nods.
Female Student
I wanted to invite him here and tell him how I felt.
Female Student
But in the end, I couldn't do it.
Female Student
And then, when I saw him here, I thought this was my chance, but...
Sumomo
Someone else beat you too it? I see.
Female Student
My face is a mess now. I want to go home.
Sumomo
What? But this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing! Are you sure you wanna go back home feeling like this?
Female Student
...

Seeing her so devastated...

It reminds me of how miserable I felt every day single day while working here.
Sumomo
Okay, come with me.
Female Student
Huh?
Sumomo
Looking like that is just making you more depressed. Come with me and I'll teach you how to do it properly.

As I remove her makeup, including the runny eyeliner, she keeps her eyes closed and begins to tell me about the boy she likes.

Apparently he's in the soccer club, is popular, and really smart.
Female Student
He talked to me once, after I read something aloud during Japanese class.
Female Student
He told me I had a nice voice, and then...
Sumomo
You were head over heels?

Well, she's at the age where girls like the gregarious types.
Sumomo
But you were thinking about telling him how you feel, right?
Sumomo
It'd be kinda lame to say it in front of her, but you can still tell him.
Female Student
He'd definitely reject me!
Sumomo
Yeah. You'd be doing it so you could get rejected.
Female Student
Why would I do that? That's just weird.
Sumomo
It's not weird, like, at all!
Sumomo
I've had feelings for lots of people, and for each one of them, I've always been happy about being honest with myself.
Female Student
Have you ever been rejected?
Sumomo
Hmm... Sorry. Not really.

My response makes her snort with laughter.
Female Student
You're supposed to comfort me by talking about your experiences with rejection!
Female Student
What advice am I supposed to get from a teacher who's never been dumped?!
Sumomo
Ahahah! Good point.

A smile starts to spread across her face.
Sumomo
You know, I think a more natural makeup look would suit you better.
Sumomo
You don't need to lay the eyeliner on so thick either.
Sumomo
And you used way too much blusher! You want it to be barely noticeable, like your cheeks are just a little flushed.
Female Student
I see!
Sumomo
And the biggest problem is this hair. Can I be honest with you? You've really gotta change your stylist. The person doing it either has no skill, or they're not trying. Or both.
Female Student
Ahah, that's definitely honest!
Sumomo
I can work with it, but my advice is to get yourself to another salon first thing tomorrow. Even tidying it up a little will make a huge difference.

I take some hair wax out of my bag.
Sumomo
I don't really have a hair iron handy, so it won't hold its shape for long.

I stare at her thick, fluffy bowl cut.

I really wanna do something about this.

I really want to help this girl.
Sumomo
Mind if I trim your bangs?
Sumomo
Look at this! Way cuter, right?! What do you think?!
Female Student
I can't believe it! You know so much about this stuff.
Sumomo
This is pretty much the only thing I'm good at. I can't even write republica—uh, what was it again?
Female Student
Ahahah! Oh, I remember that.
Sumomo
Now you can go right up to that soccer boy and strike up a conversation.
Sumomo
Even when they're with their girlfriends, men never miss a chance to stare at a cutie.
Sumomo
If you make an impression, you might even be able to turn the tables in your favor.
Female Student
...Yeah, I'll go talk to him. I might as well, since I'm here.
Sumomo
Go for it!
Sumomo
I'll be rooting for you. If you get rejected you can bawl your eyes out, then back get up and set your sights on the next guy.
Female Student
Thanks, Miss. I wish we could have talked more when you were still a teacher.
Sumomo
Me too. But I'm happy to know you really thought of me as your teacher. Thanks.
Female Student
See you later!
Sumomo
Yep. Be brave, girl!

She sucks in a deep breath before taking a resolute step into the crowd.

I watch her until she's out of sight.

Whoa, this is crazy.

I think this is the most teacher-like thing I've done since I got here.

I truly hope she doesn't have any regrets, even if she gets turned down or if the other girl causes a scene.

After I lose sight of her in the crowd, I go back and sit on my lonely bench.

I look up at the sky just like everyone else.

The comet is so big and bright tonight.

It was Kanna who taught me how beautiful the night sky could be.

I just feel...

So good inside.

I feel kind... cleansed? Like all the grime on my soul's been washed away.

I might really like listening to girls' problems and helping them doll themselves up.

The stars twinkle brightly in the sky.

In the time I've spent with him, I've learned a lot of things from Kanna.

I might remember this summer every time I look up at the night sky.

We head back to the garage before the viewing party is over.

Dad is supposed to join us for dinner and a chat.

I was able to complete the homework Spencer gave me.

I took some pictures I'm pretty happy with, so for now, I'm in a good mood.
Kanna
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Sumomo
Don't worry! I had a good time too.

Sumomo is beaming at me.

She seems a lot more peppy now than back when we were at the terminal.
Kanna
Are you... really leaving today?
Sumomo
Probably, yeah. If it gets too late, I'll check into a hotel near the station.
Kanna
...Right.

Sumomo's smile becomes a wry one.

We continue walking the city road in silence.

Cicadas cry in the distance.
Sumomo
Does your daddy drink?
Kanna
Beats me, to be honest. I think he'd have a beer or two with Mom from time to time when she was still around.
Sumomo
Gotcha. So we don't have a second Azuki on our hands.
Kanna
Don't think we gotta worry about that.
Sumomo
Let's buy some snacks to go with the booze. Let me know if there's anything he can't eat.
Kanna
All right. Let's go.
Sumomo
We're back!
Azuki
Oh, took you long enough.
Sumomo
He took lots of pictures from the roof of the academy.
Azuki
Did it go well?

I nod.
Kanna
There were lots of people there, so I got a ton of good material. I'll pick the best tomorrow and send them to Spencer.
Azuki
So we're gonna drink and watch the comet, yeah? Call your pa. We hanging out in here?
Kanna
Yeah, gonna do that now. Could you open the shutter?
Sumomo
I'm so nervous!
Azuki
This was your idea, remember?
Sumomo
I know!
Kanna
Are you sure I should go get him?

Sumomo nods.
Kanna
Okay. Wait here.

When I enter the living room, I see two boxes of pizza sitting on the table along with some wrapped bowls of salad.

Dad's sitting on the sofa, reading a magazine.
Kanna
Uh, what's with all this?
Dad
What kind of a host would I be if I didn't offer refreshments to my guests?
Kanna
I would've helped if you'd asked.
Dad
But you were out taking pictures, weren't you?
Kanna
Yeah, but...
Dad
Then you wouldn't have had the time, would you?
Kanna
...

In his own way, he's supporting my dream.

I realize that now.
Dad
Are we getting started?

I nod.
Kanna
About what we talked yesterday...
Dad
Listen. If it's what you've decided you want to do, it's fine. I'm sure Anna would be happier too that way.
Kanna
Yeah. Thanks.
Dad
There's some drinks in the fridge. Go grab a few cans.

Dad gets up and grabs the pizza boxes.

I follow behind him, loaded down with a bunch of cold shochu highball and beer cans.
Dad
Good evening.
Sumomo
Ah! Hello!
Azuki
Sup.
Dad
Thank you for inviting me. Kanna filled me in on everything. I, um, brought some pizza.
Sumomo
What?! S-Sorry, you really didn't have to! But I guess it's good since we only brought a few snacks, even though we were the ones who invited you.
Dad
Don't worry. I have a lot to thank you two for.
Sumomo
No, uh, Kanna has done so much for us. We...
Kanna
Let's put this stuff down first, my arms are about to drop off.
Dad
Right. I bought some drinks too, so we can make a toast if you like.
Sumomo
Whoa, thank you! We also bought some stuff. Feel free to help yourself.
Azuki
Whoa! So much booze!
Sumomo
Azuki! Let him pick his drink first!
Azuki
I know, geez!

Dad cracks open a beer while Sumomo and Azuki go for the highballs. Then we toast.

After that there's a bit of an awkward silence as everyone struggles to break the ice.
Dad
Miss Momonouchi...
Sumomo
Yes!
Dad
Did you finish your teacher training?
Sumomo
U-Um, yes. I kind of made it to the last day, yeah...
Sumomo
I don't know if I'll become a teacher, though.
Dad
Is that so?
Sumomo
Yes. Maybe I shouldn't admit this, but I don't think I'm cut out for it.
Dad
You don't? I heard from Kanna that you've been a very good teacher.
Dad
As a parent, it would be reassuring to know I'm entrusting my child to someone like you.
Sumomo
That's... not true. I'm not...
Kanna
I think Sumomo would make a great teacher too.
Dad
Kanna, you can't call your teacher by her first name.
Sumomo
No, it's fine! I'm not his teacher anymore.
Dad
But...
Sumomo
I feel more comfortable this way. I don't really like all that formality anyway.
Dad
I see.

There's silence again.

Azuki lets out a little burp and reaches out for her next can of booze.
Sumomo
Um, so, the first day I came here...
Dad
Yes?
Sumomo
We talked then about Kanna and how he wants to become a photographer.

Dad nods.
Sumomo
How do you feel about it now?
Dad
Not too different, to be honest. I still want Kanna to at least attend college.
Dad
But that doesn't mean I don't acknowledge my son's dream.
Dad
If he's really talented, people will recognize it and opportunities will come. If he starts receiving more job offers than he can balance with his studies, then he can consider going full time with it.
Dad
But he's not at that point yet.
Dad
I spoke to a friend of mine that's a professional in the field and he says he sees talent in him, but as his father, I still worry.

He smiles weakly.
Azuki
Oy, Candy.

Suddenly, Azuki joins the conversation, and everyone turns to her.

Her face is as red as an apple.
Azuki
I hope you know you're one lucky kid! The only person that could worry this much about your future is your pa! No one else!
Azuki
Don't make him worry! What're you so angsty for? You're blessed, man!
Azuki
Right, Pa?!
Dad
Aha, now I've got a powerful advocate.

My dad's smiling at me from ear to ear now.
Dad
Excuse me, I'm afraid I didn't catch your name?
Azuki
Ah, I'm Azuki. Scrap Hunter Azuki.
Dad
Azuki... The MeTuber Azuki?

Azuki's eyes open wide.

Both she and I stare at my dad in shock.
Kanna
Huh? What's that?
Dad
So you became a mechanic after the wave eating started?
Dad
I used to watch all your car maintenance videos.
Azuki
For real?!
Sumomo
Huh? What are you guys talking about?
Dad
Before the wave eating happened, there were people who posted videos online about all sorts of things. Azuki used to do that.
Dad
You were even driving before getting a license back then. That made it to the news.
Azuki
That was a HUGE problem for me!
Dad
Your Jimny had some incredible suspension customization.
Azuki
Oh, right! That was the first custom I ever did! It was bangin', wasn't it?
Dad
That Jimny had a hell of a turning radius.

Azuki's eyes sparkle with excitement.

The more they talk about cars, the less I follow.
Sumomo
So...
Kanna
Hm?
Sumomo
I wasn't expecting these two to hit it off like this.
Kanna
Me neither.
Sumomo
Um, we were given this at the last place we went camping. We can drink it together.

When Dad and Azuki are done talking about cars, Sumomo takes the opportunity to take the sake out of the fridge and show it to him.
Dad
Mm... From Fukushima? Whoa, you went all the way up there, Kanna?

I nod.
Dad
That's pretty far away. You could have camped somewhere closer to the city.
Kanna
I was looking for something.
Dad
Really?
Sumomo
Kanna, are you gonna ask him?
Kanna
Yeah. I didn't find it in the end anyway.
Kanna
But I'm sure he'll know. Probably.
Dad
Mm?

I show Dad the sketch.
Dad
Oh, Anna drew this.
Kanna
It's a drawing of Halley's Comet, right?
Dad
It is.
Kanna
Mom was always looking forward to the comet, so I think she wanted to take a picture of it in this place.
Dad
Wait, you don't know where this is?
Kanna
Huh?
Sumomo&Azuki
Huh?
Dad
Ahahahah!
Dad
You fixed the car and went all the way to Fukushima for this?
Kanna
What do you mean?
Dad
These are wisterias.
Kanna
Wisterias? Like the flower?
Dad
This looks like what you'd see looking up a wisteria trellis.

I take another look at the sketch.

The stuff surrounding the comet is supposed to be wisteria flowers?
Kanna
Does this tree still exist?
Dad
Yes, in a sense.

Sumomo, Azuki, and I exchange glances.
Dad
It's right here. That stump over there.

Dad points.

Following his finger, I see... the tree stump table in front of the sofa. The same one we've been using this whole time.
Kanna
That? It's here? Right here?!
Dad
That's right.

Sumomo and Azuki stare at my dad in disbelief before our gazes all slowly converge on the stump we're all sitting around.
Sumomo
No way...
Kanna
I think I get it now. The pigeons made all the wisterias around here wither and die.
Sumomo
Oh, it's just like the old man said.
Kanna
So that means Mom wanted to photograph the comet from here?

An enigmatic smile comes over Dad's face.
Dad
Wait a minute.
Dad
Here.
Kanna
Huh?
Dad
This was Anna's favorite picture.

He presents me with a photo frame.
Kanna
This is...
Sumomo
Oh, the one you have in the living room! And there's a wisteria in the background!
Kanna
You're right.
Dad
You took this picture.
Kanna
I did?
Dad
Anna was really happy about it. Said you captured her best smile.
Dad
She's the one who put it in the living room.

I take another good look at the picture.

Mom's smile really does look radiant in it.
Dad
She used to say you knew how to bring out someone's best expression.
Sumomo
She was right!
Dad
When we bought this house, there was a really impressive wisteria tree by it.
Dad
It was a huge tree, you can tell from how thick the stump is. But the pests killed it off.
Kanna
But...
Kanna
Surely there are better locations than this to photograph the comet from?
Dad
She always said that she wanted to watch the comet with her family. All of us together.
Kanna
Then why did we go camping so often? She said we were scouting locations.

Dad's mouth twists into a wry smile.
Dad
I think that was just an excuse to go camping. Whenever we had a little fight, neither of us would want to back down and apologize, and she always ended up taking us camping instead.
Dad
She was a stubborn one, and so was I.
Dad
Apparently, you are too.
Sumomo
Ahahah! You can say that again.
Dad
Anna drew that picture when the wisteria began to die. Maybe she would have taken the picture from here if it was still blooming today.
Dad
But wisteria flowers are already fading by July. You can't get this kind of view after May. This is more like Anna's dream scene, I'd say.
Kanna
...

The place I was looking for was right in front of me.

It's like a twist out of a fairy tale.

But there's no more wisteria here.

The year I took this picture...

It seems like that was the last year the wisteria bloomed at all.

I can feel the faint tension that's consumed me since Mom's death start to to fade.

I can just imagine Mom laughing her ass off as I run around like a headless chicken.
Sumomo
It's a little anti-climactic, but I guess it's better than just leaving it as a mystery, right?
Kanna
Yeah. Honestly, it feels a little like Mom was messing with me.
Sumomo
Remember what you said back in Fukushima. It's about the journey, not just the destination.
Sumomo
I agree with that.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Plus, it got you out of your funk and on the path to becoming a professional photographer.
Kanna
Yeah, it did.
Dad
And you were doomed to failure the moment you decided to go up against Anna.
Sumomo
This whole ordeal has helped you grow up, Kanna.
Kanna
I hope that's true.

Dad smiles fondly at me then looks at his wristwatch.
Dad
It's pretty late. Did you two intend to leave today?
Sumomo
Oh, yes. That's the plan.
Kanna
But it's gotten pretty late...
Dad
And Azuki's pretty drunk...
Azuki
Eh?
Sumomo
Yeah, so? Uh, why does that matter?

I look up at Dad.

He gives me a little nod.

I return it with one of my own and turn to Azuki.
Kanna
The car. I was thinking of giving it to Azuki.
Azuki
Eh? Why would you do that? Ain't that car important to you?
Kanna
Yeah, but I probably won't be able to repair it down the line like Mom and you would.
Kanna
I think Hachimaru would be way happier going all over the place with you rather than just gathering dust here.
Kanna
And...
Kanna
...I did smash your bike and burn down your house.

I whisper that last part to her.
Azuki
Err, I really don't think I can accept it. I mean, it's important to both of you, isn't it?
Dad
Please, take it, if you want it. The car won't do any good just sitting around here.

Azuki looks to me, then to Dad, and then to Hachimaru.
Azuki
The Hachimaru... You're giving it to ME?
Azuki
Are you guys sure?
Dad
As Kanna said, it was just gathering dust until you two arrived. It probably won't see much use out of us. Feel free to take it.
Azuki
I can drive Amei Anna's Hachimaru? Man, that's like a dream come true!
Kanna
Just don't sell it off, okay?
Azuki
Like I ever could! Rest easy! I'll drive it until my hands fall off.
Dad
Feel free to stay the night too. We're not in a hurry to see you off.
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
Then I guess we leave tomorrow morning.
Azuki
Yeah. Can't drive with so many drinks in me.
Dad
Have a nice night, all of you. I'll head back to the house. Let me know when you leave tomorrow.
Sumomo
Oh, you're going back already?
Dad
Yes.
Kanna
I'll stay a little longer. If that's okay?
Dad
No drinking, understand?
Sumomo
I'll watch him!
Azuki
Me too!

Dad smiles at them.
Dad
I'm counting on you two.
Sumomo
So it was here all along, huh? Who would've guessed?
Azuki
This stump won't be blooming anytime soon, though.
Sumomo
Anyway, what was that whole MeTuber thing about? You haven't always been a scrap hunter?
Azuki
I started doing that after the wave eating. Before that I made my living creating videos that lots of people watched.
Kanna
How did you make a living at that?
Azuki
Because lots of people watched me, that's how. At least one million people.
Sumomo
A million?! Are you kidding me?
Azuki
It's the truth, cross my heart. Little Azuki's channel was pretty popular back in the day.
Kanna
Then why did you become a scrap hunter? Couldn't you have kept doing that?
Azuki
Because of the wave eating, remember?
Azuki
People happily watched our videos when they were free, but then the wave eating started and most of us weren't actually good enough at anything for people to want to pay us for it.
Azuki
I had some knowledge about vehicles, so I switched to this scrap hunter gig, but there were lots of people who couldn't get a job anywhere.
Sumomo
Whoa, those radio waves sure were convenient.
Azuki
That they were. People could just call you up for car repairs anytime too.
Kanna
By the way, how is it that your videos got a hundred million people watching them?
Azuki
Who knows? Maybe my sparkling personality hooked them?
Sumomo
...

Sumomo stares intently at her.
Azuki
What?
Sumomo
...So that's it.
Azuki
What the hell do you want?
Sumomo
There's one thing that's been bothering me this whole time.
Azuki
Huh?
Sumomo
Azuki... Lemme trim that mane of hair you've got going on.
Kanna
This sure brings back memories.
Sumomo
Right? Heheh. It's just like when I cut your hair that first day, isn't it?
Azuki
You're as weird as they come. I mean, suddenly wanting to cut my hair out of nowhere? Didn't see that one coming.
Sumomo
It is kinda weird, isn't it? I didn't realize it before, but I actually really like prettying people up like this.
Sumomo
Man, I can't believe I had a diamond in the rough right here.
Sumomo
Unwashed for days on end, hair a mess—letting all your natural resources go to waste.
Azuki
Say what?!
Sumomo
Ahaha! I'll get you back to the Azuki who brought in millions of views.
Sumomo
Ta-da!
Kanna
Oooh...
Kanna
She looks like a model. So this is what was hiding underneath all that grime.
Azuki
A beauty with no parallel, aren't I?
Sumomo
Oh no, now she's getting cocky.
Azuki
I'm gonna cock my fist into your face!
Kanna
Why don't you try making it as a model? I can ask Spencer to do a shoot for you.
Azuki
What? Nah, I'll pass. I'm a mere scrap hunter. I can't go around stealing people's hearts.
Sumomo
Let me translate that for you. She's really into the idea.
Azuki
No I'm not!
Kanna
Look this way, I wanna take some photos.
Sumomo
Ah, that's not fair! I wanna get my picture taken too!
Azuki
Come on, Peach, don't get jealous now. This is just his job. It's a business relationship, that's all.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Suddenly you're a pro? It didn't take much for you to get on board, huh?
Sumomo
Kanna's gonna make you soft if you're not careful.
Azuki
Am not!

After I take some photos of Azuki with her new haircut, we go and sit at the table again.

The stump table we always gathered around now has a whole new meaning.

The night marches on.

It's our last night all together.
Azuki
I dwank too mush...
Sumomo
Uhhh, are you okay?! You've gotta drive tomorrow! I won't have you killing me in a crash!
Azuki
It's fine, don't you worry. I'll be in top shape come tomorrow. I don't even know what a hangover is...

As she speaks, Azuki plops down onto the sofa like a sack of potatoes.
Sumomo
Looks like we'll be leaving late in the day.
Kanna
Seems so.
Sumomo
Well, guess it's time for me to hit the hay too.

Sumomo throws her arms up and stretches.
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
Are you gonna sleep in your room?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
...Wanna sleep in the car with me?
Kanna
...Yeah.

I murmur my response, and Sumomo smiles at me.
Sumomo
It's our last night... We can spend it together.
Kanna
...

Sumomo takes my hand.

I look up at her.

She's still smiling, a slight rosy blush staining her cheeks.
Sumomo
It's been super fun, hasn't it?
Kanna
Yeah.

We're lying down facing each other in the small bed inside Hachimaru.

Our faces are really close.

And our feet are touching.

No matter the position, some part of our bodies comes together, which means I feel Sumomo's warmth on my skin.
Sumomo
...Kanna.
Kanna
Mm?
Sumomo
Did you make good memories this summer?

When I nod, she smiles sweetly.
Sumomo
Will you remember me?
Kanna
...Yeah.
Sumomo
Me too.

She puts her hand over mine again.
Sumomo
I'm so glad I came to see you that day.
Sumomo
I'm proud of myself for giving teaching a shot, since it led me to you.
Kanna
Yeah...
Sumomo
This really is the last night, huh?
Kanna
...

I simply nod.

Whenever she talks, her sweet breath tickles my nose.

Along with the scent of peaches from her hair.

If I'm not careful with my arms, I'm sure I'll end up touching her chest.

Unable to move, I simply stare at Sumomo.
Sumomo
I wish we could just go to bed like this.
Kanna
Mhm.
Sumomo
Truth is I want to do a lot of other things. Right now.

She flashes me a meaningful smile.

I simply stare at it, too stunned to speak.
Sumomo
But your daddy left you in my care, so we probably shouldn't.

She gives me a slightly pained smile.
Kanna
I'll wake up early and go back to my room before he notices.
Sumomo
Ahah! Really?

I nod.
Sumomo
Can you hold yourself back? We really shouldn't do anything tonight.
Kanna
...I can.
Sumomo
You had to think about it, didn't you?
Kanna
I'll wait until we can be a proper couple. You know I will.
Sumomo
Mhm, that's my boy.
Sumomo
That's what I love about you.

I silently stare at her hand, holding mine.
Sumomo
We should get some rest.
Sumomo
Sleep tight.
Sumomo
Let's meet again, no matter what. And then... we can pick up where we left off.
Kanna
...Yeah.
Sumomo
I'll be waiting for you. I'll fight the aging process and wait for you.
Kanna
You're the prettiest woman in the world. You'll be fine.
Sumomo
Thanks. I'll do my best so you can still say that, no matter how many years go by.

I fall asleep in Sumomo's arms.

That night, I have a dream.

In the dream, I'm a crybaby boy.

My car's broken and I can't fix it. I've been crying my eyes out.

But then...

A white-haired girl gently kisses my forehead.

I raise my head and see her bashful smile.

Looking up at her, I realize that I'm in love.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Kanna?
Kanna
Yeah?
Sumomo
Did you wake up?
Kanna
I think I had a dream.
Sumomo
Mhm...
Kanna
There was a girl with hair like yours...
Kanna
We were walking through a cornfield, and then...
Sumomo
The boy was crying, so the girl kisses him, right?
Kanna
...

I raise my head.

Sumomo blinks slowly, like her eyelids are really heavy.
Kanna
How did you know?
Sumomo
I had the same dream.
Kanna
Is that even possible?

She slowly shakes her head.
Sumomo
It's never happened to me before, at least.
Kanna
Me either.
Sumomo
Eheheh, I'm happy that my first time was with you.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Let's go back to sleep. Then sun's not up yet.
Kanna
Okay.
Sumomo
Good night.
Kanna
Night.
Azuki
That everything, Peach?
Sumomo
Yeah! All in!
Azuki
So I gotta drive you to Tokyo, right?
Sumomo
Pretty please!

In the afternoon, when Azuki's hangover has subsided, the girls gather their luggage and load it up into Hachimaru.

Hachimaru's engine rumbles to life.

Then, it slowly pulls out of the garage.

Dad and I stand side by side, watching Hachimaru leave.

They come to a stop in the middle of the yard, and Sumomo gets out of the car and comes up to us.

The sunset tinges Sumomo's fair skin a shade of red.
Sumomo
We'll be going now.
Dad
You're welcome to come by again whenever you like.
Sumomo
Thank you. Next time I'll come and say hi before crashing on your couch.

The comment gets a chuckle from Dad.

I step forward to stand in front of her.
Kanna
...Sumomo.
Sumomo
Yeah?
Kanna
I love you.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
I'm so glad we met. And I'm grateful to you for dragging me back to the academy.
Sumomo
Mm.
Kanna
I wish you could stay with me forever.
Kanna
I'm afraid I might lose my way again on my own.
Kanna
I want you by my side.
Sumomo
Thank you, Kanna.
Sumomo
That makes me so happy—it really does. But this is a very important time for you, and I can't bear to get in the way of that.
Kanna
You wouldn't be in my way.
Sumomo
Besides, I'm also thinking about going back to college.
Sumomo
This time, I'll study what I really want to do.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I'm going to do my best to become someone just as accomplished as I know you'll be.
Sumomo
You know, we're both still kind of kids right now.

With my head hanging down, I can feel the tears welling up in my eyes.
Sumomo
Someday, when we're both properly grown up...
Sumomo
Tell me how you feel then.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I'll be waiting. I'll wait for as long as it takes for you to become a super cool photographer.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
So...
Sumomo
Let's both do our very best.
Kanna
...

All I can do is nod.
Kanna
...Okay.

I manage to squeeze out that quavering word.

My vision is blurry with tears.

I can't even see my feet anymore.

But then...

This time, I understand right away.

The soft feeling on my forehead is Sumomo's lips.

Just like that night in the forest.

Sumomo's gentle kiss gives me courage.

Her breath stirs my bangs.

It feels like her warmth is flowing right into me from her lips.

And then, she slowly pulls her lips away.
Sumomo
Bye, Kanna. We'll definitely see each other again.
Kanna
...Yeah.
Sumomo
I'll be waiting for you, okay?
Kanna
...Okay.
Sumomo
I'm going now.

I just nod.

I hear her footsteps recede.

At the same time, I can hear Dad walk up behind me.
Dad
Don't look down, Kanna.
Kanna
...
Dad
You're gonna go get her someday, right? If so, then you need to see her off now.
Kanna
...

He places one hand on my shoulder.
Dad
You're a man now, aren't you?
Kanna
...Yeah.

I raise my face.

Sumomo is in the passenger seat now.

She's looking at me with a smile on her face and tears in her eyes.
Kanna
I'll come find you, Sumomo.
Sumomo
Yeah!
Kanna
Wait for me.
Sumomo
I will! I can't wait!

I force myself to smile as I wave goodbye.

Just like her, with tears in my eyes.
Kanna
You take care too, Azuki!
Azuki
You too, Candy. It was a good time.
Kanna
It was for me too.
Azuki
You ready, Peach?
Sumomo
Yes.

Azuki revs up Hachimaru's diesel engine.

The car rolls forward, crunching on the gravel in front of the garage.

Dad and I watch my two precious friends set off on their journey with Mom's Hachimaru.
Kanna
Ngh... *Sniff*

I start to weep, my dad still holding my shoulder.

His hand never wavers. He holds me close and reassures me.
Dad
Crying is nothing to be ashamed of.
Dad
It sounds like you had a really good summer.
Kanna
Mhm.
Kanna
...I'll go to the academy like I should.
Kanna
I'll see if I can study something that'll help with my photography even as an undergrad.
Kanna
I want to become a man worthy of Sumomo.
Kanna
So I'll do my best to become that person.
Dad
I'm sure you will.
Dad
In fact, I know you will.
Kanna
Thanks, Dad.
Kanna
I'm sorry for causing you so much worry.

He doesn't answer. Instead, he grips my shoulder with quiet strength.

That's enough to convey his feelings to me.

Looking out at the scenery as it flows by, memories of summer replay in my mind.

I wonder if I've ever had as much fun as I did these past few weeks.

Probably not.

I've probably never felt this lonely before either.
Sumomo
It was so much fun.

The evening breeze of summer carries my tears away.

I'm so sad I can't help but cry, and so happy I can't help but smile.
Azuki
You sure about leaving?
Sumomo
Hm?
Azuki
You're still on summer break, right?
Sumomo
Yeah, but I think I have to move forward too.
Azuki
Forward?
Sumomo
Forward, yeah.
Sumomo
I mean, you saw how much he grew up in such a short time. He'll be disappointed if I just stay the same.
Sumomo
He'll start thinking I'm not as awesome as he thought.
Azuki
You think so? I think you're pretty funny as you are.
Sumomo
I'm not looking to just be funny! I'm gonna become a proper lady that can make Kanna's jaw drop to the floor!
Azuki
Gotcha.
Sumomo
Haah... It's been a lifetime since I fell in love like this.
Azuki
Youth sure is nice.
Sumomo
No joke... Hah, even I'm laughing at how silly I am.
Sumomo
But... I never thought I'd ever fall for someone so completely.
Sumomo
I think I like it.
Azuki
That so?
Sumomo
I kept it platonic in the end! Good job, me!
Azuki
Huh, so you didn't do the dirty after all?
Sumomo
Yeah, figured I'd delay gratification for once.
Azuki
...You truly are the bitchy peach.
Sumomo
I'll be waiting for you, Kanna.
