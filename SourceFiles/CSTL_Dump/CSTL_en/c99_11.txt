...

I raise myself up as I open my eyes.
Yonagi
Kaito... Good morning.
Kaito
Morning.
Yonagi
Did you sleep well?
Kaito
...

My silence is met with a confused tilt of her head.

I see Izumo and Wooleep come into the room, but I raise my hand at Izumo to keep her from speaking up.

Izumo said that Yonagi would regress, but to me, it looks like she's displaying more emotion than before.

I must be imagining things.

I decide to try something we've done before to see how she reacts.

If she really is regressing, then...
Kaito
...Yonagi.
Yonagi
Yes?
Kaito
Do you wanna play?
Yonagi
Yeah!
Kaito
What do you wanna do?
