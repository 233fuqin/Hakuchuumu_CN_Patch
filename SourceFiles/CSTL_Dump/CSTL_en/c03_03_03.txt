It's finally over.

I feel lighter than ever.

I don't think I've been this excited for summer break since I was a kid.
Sumomo
Kanna!

Turning around, I see Sumomo chasing after me with that huge bag of hers.
Sumomo
Let's go back together!
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
I'm not a teacher anymore. We can walk back together.
Kanna
Uh, that's not what I mean.
Kanna
Go back where?
Sumomo
To the garage. You wanna do something this summer, right?
Kanna
Yeah, but—
Sumomo
Let me help you with it.
Kanna
Why?
Sumomo
Because I wanna help you.
Sumomo
And I want you to take lots of cute pictures.
Sumomo
And I want you to tell me I'm pretty again!
Kanna
What? I never said anything like that.
Sumomo
Grr! You SO did when you were taking pictures of me before.
Kanna
Did I?
Sumomo
You didn't even notice?! You fucking jerk!
Kanna
Err, I kind of remember, actually...
Sumomo
Pleeease let me help!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Pretty please?
Kanna
...Suit yourself.
Sumomo
Right on! Come on, let's bounce!
Kanna
What's the rush?
Sumomo
I hate this stinking place!
Kanna
You did good lasting two whole weeks, huh?
Sumomo
Ahahah! I can't believe I did that!
Sumomo
But I like your garage lots! So let's gooo!
Kanna
...Okay.
Azuki
Huh?
Sumomo
Hellow, Miss Scrap Hunter.
Azuki
Uh, who's this?
Kanna
Figures.
Sumomo
I'm Sumomo!
Azuki
Peach?!
Sumomo
In the flesh! My teacher training is over! In more ways than one.
Azuki
What's with the outfit?
Sumomo
I normally look like this, pretty much. The stuff from before was my boring teacher costume.
Azuki
Hah... Heheh!
Azuki
I knew my eyes didn't deceive me! Now you're the very image of the Bitchy Peach!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're soooo lame!
Azuki
No, I'm not!
Sumomo
So, spill it already! What are you trying to do, Kanna?
Kanna
...

I go get Mom's sketch from the car.
Kanna
I'm looking for this place.
Azuki
What's that?
Kanna
My mom's sketch.
Azuki
By your mom, you mean Amei Anna?
Sumomo
Whoa! She was a woman of many talents!
Azuki
Is that the comet we're seeing now?
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
Halley's Comet!

Sumomo looks really pleased with herself for some reason.
Sumomo
I remember!

Her smile is contagious, and I end up mirroring it.
Azuki
Where's this supposed to be?
Kanna
I don't know.
Sumomo
Oh, really?
Kanna
Mom died before telling me.

There's a moment of silence after that.
Kanna
Mom had been looking forward to photographing the comet for as long as I can remember.
Kanna
We went camping almost every week to different places so she could search for the best place to shoot it from, since it only comes around once every 76 years.
Sumomo
Ooh.
Azuki
With this Hachimaru here?

I nod.
Azuki
Makes sense now.
Sumomo
So she found the place while she was still alive?
Kanna
One trip, she told me that she had found the place already.
Sumomo
Really?!
Kanna
But she didn't tell me where it is.
Kanna
I found the sketch inside Hachimaru after she passed.

I look up.
Kanna
I want to find the place and be there the day that the comet is closest to Earth.
Kanna
On July 28th of this year, I want to take the picture she always planned to.
Azuki
On Anna's behalf, you mean?

I nod.
Sumomo
Man, that's super cool! I'm all in! Let's do this thing! It'll be like a treasure hunt!
Azuki
Geez, you could've told me sooner that this car means so damn much to you.
Kanna
Did you ever think that maybe I didn't wanna sell it for a reason?!
Azuki
Heh. Leave the car to me.
Azuki
I'll get it fixed up. I swear on my honor as a scrap hunter.
Sumomo
Ahahahah! You're so tacky!
Azuki
You wouldn't know cool if it hit you right on that empty head of yours!
Kanna
...Thanks.
Azuki
...
Sumomo
And me?! What can I do?!
Kanna
I listed out all the campsites I visited with my mom. I want you to help me look them up, one by one.
Sumomo
Okay!
Sumomo
This is gonna be SO fun! It's gonna be such a great summer! Maybe God is finally rewarding me for working so hard!
Azuki
Wow, you can be pretty self-centered, huh?
Kanna
I'm sure it'll be fun!
Sumomo
Yeah! I bet!
Sumomo
Let's get started! We have the whole summer to look forward to! This'll be our secret project!
Sumomo
Operation Find Anna's Secret Spot!
Azuki
Your ideas for names are almost as crap as mine! I don't wanna hear you call me lame ever again!
Kanna
...

Sumomo's right.

The summer's just getting started for the three of us.
