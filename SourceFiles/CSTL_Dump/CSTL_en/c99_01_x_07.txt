But...

I can't remember anything before that.
Kaito
Huh? I...
Yonagi
...

I scan the room slowly.

Next to me is a bed just like mine.

The two beds are the only things in the otherwise stark and empty room.

Where am I? Who is she?

Who am I?

I put a hand to my forehead and think.

I can't remember a thing.

All I can recall is the dream I just had.
Kaito
Were you sleeping too?
Yonagi
...

The girl gives a small nod.

Or so it seems.

It was so slight, I wonder if I'm imagining things.
Kaito
...

Just then, the door to the room opens.

Another girl comes into the room.

And beside her, hovering in the air, is a small robot made up of spheres like a snowman.
Izumo
Good morning.
Kaito
Uh...
Izumo
I imagine you have questions. This way.

She abruptly turns her back on us.
Kaito
Err, um...
Izumo
Yes?
Kaito
...

The white-haired girl trots over to the open door, barefoot.

Seeing this, the other girl walks to the bed and picks up a pair of sandals before returning to the doorway.

She doesn't seem to mean us any harm, at least.
Izumo
Are you coming?
Kaito
Uh, okay.

I hurriedly get to my feet.

The polished white floor feels warm against my soles.

I notice a pair of sandals lined up beside my own bed. I put them on and hurry to the exit.

The interior of the whole place appears consistently drab.

Everything feels unnatural and inorganic.

And yet, I can smell a faint trace of a wooden scent.

The corridor is also warm.

The whole place seems to maintain a placid temperature.

As we walk, I think of what questions to ask.
Izumo
Here.

The girl places a big, round plate in front of me.

She does the same for the white-haired girl.

The two plates are set perfectly perpendicular to each other.
