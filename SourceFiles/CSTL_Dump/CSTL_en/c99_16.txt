Kaito
...

I press my hands against my eyes.

I feel the dull pain of separating from a loved one. It's as real as it gets.
Kaito
...

Still covering my eyes, I sit up in the bed.

After taking a moment to get over the dream, I take my hands off my eyes and turn to Yonagi's bed.
Kaito
Yonagi?

But she isn't there.
Kaito
Yonagi? Where are you?

I get up and scan the room.

But there's no one other than me.
Izumo
Good job.
Kaito
...
Izumo
The plan...
Izumo
...was a success.
Kaito
Where's Yonagi?
Izumo
She left this facility out of her own volition.
Kaito
What?
Kaito
Is she okay?
Izumo
Wooleep is with her. Her location data is being tracked.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito
But I'm still worried. We should go after her.

Izumo slowly shakes her head.
Izumo
You need to regain your memories first.
Kaito
...
Izumo
Preparations are ready. This way.

She says, before turning back and heading out into the corridor.

I follow after her until she stops in front of a room I've never entered before.
Kaito
Here?
Izumo
Once you enter this room...
Izumo
You will remember. All of your memories will return.
Kaito
...

I stare at the door, a little bit of a pit forming in my stomach.
Izumo
Well then.

With that, Izumo turns her back on me and walks away.
Kaito
Are you going to find Yonagi?
Izumo
That is not my duty.

I mull over those words for a moment.

Izumo keeps her level stare aimed at me.
Izumo
I will be waiting. In the place we promised.
Kaito
What...

Will I understand when I get memories back?

Without another word, Izumo leaves.
Kaito
My memories, huh?

I take a deep breath and enter the room.
Kaito
...

I slowly step into a circular room.

The door closes soundlessly behind me.

I take a moment to look over the space.

And then...

At first it's just a faint outline, but before long, a fully three-dimensional image is projected into the middle of the room.
Kaito
...

And it's me.
Kaito (Hologram)
...Maybe you're not surprised at all to see me here.

I shake my head, and the projection chuckles.
Kaito (Hologram)
Good to hear. That makes me feel a bit relieved. Glad to know I didn't throw away my potential along with my memories.
Kaito
So the one who arranged all this...
Kaito (Hologram)
Was me, of course. No, perhaps I should say 'us.'
Kaito (Hologram)
Well, you know what I mean.
Kaito (Hologram)
What's happening right now? How's Yonagi?
Kaito
I don't know. Once the third dream ended, she went away.
Kaito (Hologram)
I see. So it was a success.

I gaze at my projection and see it slowly inhaling and exhaling.

But he's not actually breathing; he's just a hologram.

It's probably a virtual representation of my personality made up of my memories and thought patterns from before my memories were erased.
Kaito
Think you could cut to the chase and start making sense?
Kaito
I don't know anything. I don't know what happened to Yonagi or who I even am.
Kaito (Hologram)
I won't take much of your time. You are about to live out your memories through me.
Kaito
What?

Live them through him?
Kaito (Hologram)
Just like you have been receiving and living Yonagi's dreams.
Kaito (Hologram)
Now you will relive your own memories.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito (Hologram)
I judged this to be the best method to ensure my recovery from the induced total amnesia.
Kaito
So I'll be reliving my memories? That doesn't sound too efficient to me.
Kaito (Hologram)
I set the information density to the maximum. You will relive a lifetime of memories in less than a single hour.
Kaito (Hologram)
Once you do that, you will know where Yonagi went.
Kaito (Hologram)
Once you can resonate with Yonagi's feelings, her location should become clear.
Kaito (Hologram)
Our time together will tell you all you need to know.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito (Hologram)
Are you ready?
Kaito
Whenever you are.
Kaito (Hologram)
Heh, let's get this started then. These are my... our memories.
