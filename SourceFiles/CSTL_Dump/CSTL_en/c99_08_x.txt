We go to the dining room, and Izumo prepares the usual meal.

Yonagi and I sit at our usual spots and pick up our spoons.
Yonagi
...

I silently glance at Yonagi as she eats.

I'm not imagining things.

Her intelligence, cognitive abilities, and judgment faculties are improving.

And it seems that her preferences are somehow linked to the personality of the person that appears in our dreams.

Are we seeing Yonagi's memories or something?

After the meal, Yonagi takes a shower and goes back to bed.

It doesn't seem like she needs Izumo's constant help anymore.

As time goes by, she can do more things by herself.
Izumo
Are you gonna take a shower too?
Kaito
Yeah, guess I will.
Izumo
I will prepare a change of clothes.
Kaito
Will the next dream be a continuation of the last one?

Izumo nods.
Izumo
Once you reach the conclusion of this dream, you will have to choose another dream.
Izumo
So you will be choosing from the remaining two.
Kaito
All right.
Kaito
I'll take a shower and go back to sleep.

Izumo nods solemnly and leaves the room with Wooleep.
