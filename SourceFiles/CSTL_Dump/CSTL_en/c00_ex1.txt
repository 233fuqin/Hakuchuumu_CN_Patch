Izumo
I'm back.
Yonagi
Welcome back! You were out shopping, right? We're having Italian today?
Izumo
Yes. I also acquired this.

Izumo says as she pulls two bottles from her shopping bag and sets them on the table.
Kaito
Oh, wine.
Yonagi
Wine? That's alcohol?
Kaito
Yeah. You can only make it from plants with high sugar content, so we never could have had this back underground.
Yonagi
So it's not like that corn whiskey thing.
Kaito
That was just distilled liquor. This is fermented. You make it in a different way, and it certainly tastes different. I've never actually drunk any, though. I'm just reciting stuff from encyclopedias.
Izumo
The owner of the new liquor store in the market is a wine connoisseur.
Yonagi
Wow!
Izumo
He heard the story of Hatano Rin here, and that kickstarted his new hobby.
Yonagi
Whoa!
Kaito
That's the part where Arishima gets mad, right? Don't think they ever got to drink that in the end, huh?
Izumo
Since this locale is plentiful in seafood, he recommended we try different types of white wine.
Yonagi
That's great! Let's drink!

Izumo nods as she sets three glasses on the table.
Yonagi
It'll be my first time drinking wine!

Izumo dexterously removes the cork from one of the bottles.

I can't help but stare as a thought crosses my mind.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Why the dour face, Kaito?
Kaito
Err... Just wondering what could happen to Izumo if she drinks.

Izumo looks up and returns my gaze.

...Could she be offended?
Izumo
I have always had an inebriation function.
Yonagi
A what?!
Izumo
Lonely topsider bachelors apparently liked to make drinking partners out of androids.
Kaito
Makes sense. It doesn't sound very fun to get drunk on your own while your company is all sober.
Yonagi
That's amazing! It means we can all get drunk together!

Izumo nods and holds up the bottle.

She then pours an equal amount of wine into the three glasses.

The thin glasses condensate ever so slightly, frosting the honey-colored liquid as it settles.
Izumo
Enjoy.
Yonagi
Thanks!
Kaito
Yeah, thank you.
Izumo
Cheers.
Yonagi
Cheers!
Izumo
You two are awful! You still just see me as a friggin android, don't you?! You think I don't know?!
Yonagi
Ahahahah! That's your drunk program? Man, what a drag!
Izumo
Now I'm the drag?! I'll have you know we all have the same bodies in this world! I'm not made out of metal!
Yonagi
We've never thought of you as a machine to begin with, silly! Right?
Kaito
Huh? Uh, yeah.
Izumo
Look how he faltered! He had to think about it! You think I'm blind or what!? I'm not stupid, you know?!
Kaito
No, Izumo, I...

The inebriation feature is actually pretty good. Her cheeks are slightly red and all.

Someone would actually program this kind of personality for a drinking partner?

I really don't know what goes through the mind of topsiders sometimes.
Izumo
I can see it already! He's thinking something mighty rude about me again! By the Lord, I hope you're not having any dirty thoughts about me!
Izumo
I can see right through that clueless face of yours!
Yonagi
Kaito's a creepy drunk like that?!
Izumo
Nah, nah, he's always been a dirty perv! I know better than anyone!
Yonagi
Agreed.
Kaito
I think you've had a little too much to drink, Izumo.
Izumo
No such thing! It's impossible for me to drink too much! Though you wouldn't know that, would you? Not something you saw in one of your dumb encyclopedias, right?
Kaito
Of course not...
Izumo
Aahahahahah!
Yonagi
Pfft, what's that laughter?
Izumo
This guy's just a riot.
Kaito
I feel like a clown.
Izumo
And you wouldn't be wrong! Life in the virtual space sure is a riot with a clown like you around! Ahahahahah!

Izumo downs the rest of her wine then proceeds to pour herself another generous glassful.
Yonagi
She's so much fun! We should do this more often.
Kaito
Y-Yeah... Very, very occasionally.
Izumo
Stop that! Don't get chummy in front of me! I've had enough of your damn flirting! I live in this house too! Have some decency!
Yonagi
We're not! I swear!
Izumo
You are! You totally are!
Kaito
We're just talking about how we should drink together again.
Izumo
Really? Is he telling the truth, Yonagi?
Yonagi
Yeah, for real! He said we can do this again sometime. Very occasionally, he said.
Kaito
Excuse me?!
Izumo
Ahahahahah!

She throws her head back and lets out a maniacal laugh before letting her head drop back down... all the way forward until it thunks sonorously against the table.
Yonagi
I-Izumo?
Izumo
Wh-What a riot... Heheh... Drinkin's fun...
Izumo
I love you all... Kaito, Yonagi, Wooleep...
Yonagi
Izumo?
Kaito
She fell asleep?
Yonagi
I think this is the first time I've ever seen her sleep.
Kaito
She never really slept back in the low side.

I fetch a blanket from a shelf and cover Izumo with it.
Yonagi
She looked like she was having a blast, heheh.

I nod, feeling a conflicted smile forming on my face.
Kaito
From an engineer's point of view, I'm really taken aback by how thorough the creator of this inebriation feature was.
Yonagi
Ahahah! Right! But it was fun. Izumo's such a good girl.
Kaito
Yeah, that she is.
Yonagi
The white wine's delicious too. Let's drink a bit more. Here.

Yonagi tips the mouth of the bottle towards me.

I drink the last bit of wine left in my glass and present it to her.

She carefully pours me another glass.

Then I do the same for her.
Yonagi
Here's to our precious family getting drunk together for the first time.

We raise our glasses and share a quiet moment.
Kaito
Haah...

Next morning.

We drank quite a lot yesterday.

In the end, Yonagi and I stayed up drinking until dawn.

We ended up passing out on the sofa.

I look next to me, my groggy eyes protesting against the light.

Yonagi is still sleeping away peacefully.

I give her head a light stroke and cover her bare shoulders with a blanket.

I need to drink some water.

I get up, my raw throat urging me on.

Izumo's still sprawled over the dinner table.

In the same position as we left her yesterday, worryingly enough.
Kaito
Izumo?!

But then, she stirs from her sleep.

She slowly raises her head, directing her expressionless gaze at me.
Kaito
...Morning.
Izumo
...Good morning.

Her voice sounds slightly more subdued than usual.
Kaito
Uh, you okay?

She shakes her head.
Izumo
My head hurts.

We stay put for what seems like ten minutes, the only sounds in the room the hush of the tide outside and Yonagi's soft breathing.

Izumo keeps her gaze set steady on me the whole time.
Kaito
You have a hangover function too?!
