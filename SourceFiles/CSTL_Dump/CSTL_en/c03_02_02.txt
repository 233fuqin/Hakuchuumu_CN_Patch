Kanna
*Sigh*

I'm still tired from yesterday.

My clothes still weren't dry when I woke up.

Azuki was sleeping away on the sofa like a baby.

Mental note: Never let Azuki drink again.

Or at the very least, not in the garage.

Today is day two.

This time my classmates didn't pay me much mind as I entered the classroom.

I sit by the window just like yesterday.

The bell rings at the same time as yesterday, and Sumomo comes into the room.

I watch her as she takes attendance.

There's something weird about her.

I don't get it.

It's like she's a different person here.

Seeing her like this, there's something definitively different.

I keep wondering why that is, and also why it's making me feel so anxious.

The last class on Tuesday morning turns out to be with Sumomo.

The subject is world history.
Sumomo
Um, because of all this, uh, unrest in Rome, they kind of realized that they might need, like, a kingly figure or a leader or something.
Sumomo
And then, since the people didn't want kings anymore, they made something called the republicanism.

Sumomo writes on the whiteboard as she dictates the lesson.
Female Student
Teacher.
Sumomo
Yes?!
Female Student
I think you misspelled that word.
Sumomo
Huh?! Uh, really?!

She erases one letter of the word and replaces it with another.

I can't say I've seen that term before.
Female Student
Sorry, not that one.
Sumomo
Ah, th-this one?

She replaces another letter.

It still looks kind of wrong.
Female Student
Please look at the textbook.
Sumomo
R-Right, sorry. I-I'm really sorry.

She flips through the textbook in a hurry.

An awkward silence sets in like a haze over the classroom.

The homeroom teacher is still sitting at the back of the room.

His loud sigh of disappointment can be heard in every corner of the silent classroom.
Sumomo
Ah, like this...

So that's how you write republicanism.
Sumomo
Is that right?

Everyone in the class nods silently.

Her whole lesson pretty much went like that.

By the end, I felt like her own nervousness rubbed off on me, making me jittery and anxious.

Sumomo seemed happy that me coming back to class would help her get her license, but I wonder if it'll do her any good.

I'm not completely sure she'd be any good at this even if she did get her degree.
Kanna
...

Perhaps because of Sumomo's lesson, at lunchtime I'm so exhausted I don't feel hungry at all.

I decide to kill some time on a rooftop bench.

Around me are gaggles of female students eating their lunch.

Most of the benches are packed.

On one of them sits a young man, surrounded by three girls.

The man is tall and his hair is cut short.

From what I overhear of the girl's talking, it seems like the man is also a college student doing his teacher training.

And a few benches to the side of them, I notice a familiar silhouette.

It's Sumomo, eating a pastry alone.
Kanna
...

Is there such a gulf between fellow students?

It seems kind of cruel.

After staring at her for a while, she finally notices me.

She flashes me a smile and waves.

I give her a little nod in response.

Is she gonna come and sit with me?

But right as I think she's going to get up, Sumomo lowers her hand and turns back to her pastry.
Kanna
...

What the hell?

Where did Sumomo go and what did that woman do to her?

There's something wrong here.

I get up and look out at Terminal 1 instead.

You can see the rubble from here.

I have two more classes this afternoon.

When I'm done with that, I'll go take pictures there again.

And so, after classes are over, I head to Terminal 1.

At the end of this road is a no entry zone, with nothing but ruins and trashed planes beyond.

That means no one comes here.

The garage has become a loud mess these last few days.

So getting some alone time is a godsend.

I take my camera out of its bag and hang it around my neck.

Slipping through the yellow and black tape, I head inside.

The deeper I go, the wider the space becomes.

Since the planes are so big, I figure you needed a lot of space back when there were lots of them.

I look at the scenery through my viewfinder.

I see an abandoned truck and a huge pole topped with busted lights.

Thick summer clouds roll by in the background.

I lose track of time taking pictures of the images reflected in my viewfinder, and before long, the sun starts setting.

Guess it's about time I head back home.

I look up at the scarlet sky.

I see the comet making its way through the scarlet expanse.

The comet is getting closer and closer to the destination of its 76 year trip.

I'll make it in time.

Azuki's repairing the car.

There aren't that many things you can photograph at night, and I'll be able to search for the place freely.

I'm so deep in my thoughts, I don't notice the footsteps coming closer until they're right behind me.
Kanna
Huh?!

Who else would come here?!

That doesn't matter; being found by anyone here would mean trouble.

And I definitely don't need more of that.

I consider trying to hide in the shadow of the abandoned car, but as soon as I turn around, I find myself face to face with the source of the footsteps.
???
Ah...
Kanna
...

Busted.

I wonder what this person's doing here.

They don't look like someone out on patrol.

She's wearing a white blouse with light pink detailing and has long white hair.

The tips of which are also tinged with pink.

And she's carrying a huge bag at her side.
???
Oh? What are you doing here?
Kanna
...
???
Kanna.
Kanna
Huh?!

The woman smiles at me.
Sumomo
It's me, Sumomo!
Kanna
Wha?
Sumomo
You found me! Did you follow me here?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Hello? Earth to Kanna?
Kanna
Uh... What? Sumomo?
Sumomo
That's me.
Kanna
Why do you look so... different?
Sumomo
You don't like it?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Figures.
Kanna
What are you doing here?
Sumomo
Dressing up!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I'm being the best me!
Kanna
Here?
Sumomo
Yeah!
Kanna
Alone?
Sumomo
Yep.
Kanna
But why?
Sumomo
Because people tell me to dye my hair black. And I'm tired of getting chewed out when I try to wear nice clothes.
Sumomo
But I'm the kinda gal that starts stressing out when she can't shine, you know?
Sumomo
That's why I sneak in here and transform!
Kanna
Transform?
Sumomo
Yes. Into the me I love to be!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Did I surprise you?
Kanna
That's an understatement.

I'm damn surprised.

Because...

We're here for the same reason.

We're kind of doing the same thing.

I come here to take pictures so I don't have to tell anyone that I want to become a photographer.

And Sumomo comes here to look the way she wants to without anyone getting on her case about it.

Sumomo smiles at me.

It's a desolate, sad smile.

Sumomo's true white hair drifts in the wind, glowing with the evening sun as a backdrop.

Her face is slightly downturned, eyes closed.

I raise my camera and snap a shot.
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
Ah, sorry.
Sumomo
Wait, what?
Kanna
Um, I just...
Sumomo
Y-Yes?
Kanna
Can I take some?
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
Photos.
Sumomo
O-Of me?

I nod.
Sumomo
Wh-Why?!
Kanna
Because I want to.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
You look prettier than usual.
Sumomo
Ah... Heheh! Really?!
Kanna
Yeah. You look miles better now. I just want to take pictures of you.
Sumomo
...

I lift my camera again.
Sumomo
Ah, er... What should I do?
Kanna
Just act natural. Same as always.
Sumomo
A-Act natural? W-Well, that's not too helpful.
Kanna
Okay. Then tell me why you like this place so much.
Kanna
Tell me about the kind of places you like.
Sumomo
W-Well... It's so wide and open!

I take a picture of her spreading her arms wide.
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
And there's no one around!
Kanna
Yes, good.
Sumomo
And... it's quiet.
Kanna
Yeah, that's good. Your expression's loosening.
Sumomo
Ah!
Kanna
Hm?
Sumomo
What's that?! A shooting star?! It's not moving!

I lower the camera and look at her.
Kanna
You've gotta be kidding me...
Sumomo
Kanna! Look at it! Do you see it?!
Kanna
That's Halley's Comet. It's been there for the last three months.
Sumomo
No way! Really?!
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
Hahah! Am I, like, super out of the loop?
Kanna
It sure seems so.
Sumomo
Ahahahah!

Laughing freely, she looks up at the sky again.
Sumomo
Well that's not news to me!
Kanna
...

The moment I snap that picture, I feel like my breathing stops.

Yes. This is it.

This is the Sumomo I wanted to see.

The Sumomo I wanted to capture.

I wanted to see her laughing like no one else can.

No matter what she looks like, this is something she can't hide.

It's a crime that someone with such a great smile is made to be sad.

This is what irks me so much when I see her in the classroom.

It's because I know.

I know just how beautiful Sumomo looks when she's happy and laughing.

I know.

Those are the thoughts racing through my mind as I press the shutter.
Kanna
...You're beautiful. Really beautiful.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
You have a really great smile.
Sumomo
Whoa, you're incredible.
Kanna
Huh?
Sumomo
I can't believe you can say something so corny with a straight face.
Sumomo
I think it's the first time someone has been that straightforward with me.
Kanna
...

Her words make me blush a little.

My face feels hot now.
Sumomo
You know...
Sumomo
Maybe you do have talent! As a photographer, I mean.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
You made me have lots of fun being photographed! For real!

Now I'm certain.

My blushing is so intense it's hard to hide even under the setting sun.

When night falls, we walk together down the abandoned road.
Kanna
What's with the hair?
Sumomo
It's a wig.
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
Fake hair.

She pulls out a familiar swath of hair cut in the shape of a bowl from her bag.
Sumomo
Heheheh, bet you couldn't tell. I'm super proud of my work.
Kanna
You made It yourself?
Sumomo
Yeah. It was a little more ruffled before, but I fixed it up.
Kanna
That's an amazing skill.
Sumomo
Right?!
Kanna
Still...
Sumomo
Hm?
Kanna
Do you really need to do all this?
Kanna
The whole teaching thing. You really wanna be a teacher?
Sumomo
Ahahah... Don't ask me that, dummy.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Sorry. I've been meaning to apologize to you.
Kanna
Me?

She nods.
Kanna
For what?
Sumomo
Because you already decided what you wanna do with your life.
Sumomo
You wanna be a photographer, right?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
If I didn't drag you to class, you'd have more time to actually do what you wanna do, instead of wasting it on other stuff.
Sumomo
I realized for real today. It's the first time I've seen you enjoying yourself like that.
Sumomo
And I really feel like I'm super getting in the way of your dreams for my own sake.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I think it's amazing how you already know what your passion is while you're so young.
Sumomo
People usually have no idea, so they just go to college in the meantime to kill some time.
Kanna
But you're doing the teacher thing because you want to, right?
Kanna
It's the same thing. I don't think it'd be a bad thing to have a teacher like you.
Kanna
As long as it's the real you. Like right now.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Was the me from earlier today that bad?
Kanna
I think anyone could tell you that.
Sumomo
Yeah, figures.
Kanna
You should just be like you wanna be all the time. I think that's the best way to be.
Sumomo
I can't! I wouldn't be taken seriously.
Kanna
...

For a while, only our footsteps echo along the lonely road back home.
Sumomo
I ran away from home, you know?
Kanna
Really?
Sumomo
Back when I was 20.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
One day I ended up having to live with my mom. Money was tight and things got really tense between us. And I'm a huge idiot, so I ran away.
Sumomo
I took up jobs in hostess clubs to earn money, and I drank like a fish every single night.
Sumomo
I was surrounded by adult men and earning my own money. Back then I thought that I'd become a real adult.
Sumomo
Mom found a new partner and was happy again. After a while, we reconnected and starting getting along pretty well.
Kanna
Uh-huh.
Sumomo
When I met her new husband for the first time and he asked about my job, I told him with my head held high, like it was the most normal thing ever. I thought it was a job like any other.
Sumomo
Then he asked if I was some kind of whore, and started grilling my mom about whether she used to do that kind of thing as well. I don't think I've ever seen her drink a drop of alcohol in my life.
Sumomo
I got super frustrated, and Mom was crying about it.
Sumomo
I thought he was a really huge douche, and that he was being mean for no reason. But then I went back to university and realized that there's lots of people who would look down on the kind of stuff I did. Hate me for it, even.
Kanna
...I see.
Sumomo
You probably feel the same way, right?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
It's fine. Just be honest.
Kanna
Well... I guess.

She smiles at me.

That same sad smile I saw back at Terminal 1.
Sumomo
That's why I wanna take life seriously now!
Sumomo
It's not like I'm living with my mom anymore. If I graduate and become a teacher, she'll be able to tell people about me with pride.
Kanna
I don't think that's a reason to change yourself though.
Kanna
I think it's fine for you to stay the way you are.
Kanna
If you prefer that job where you drink and entertain people, I think you should do it.
Sumomo
Well, it's not like it was all sunshine and roses every day. I used to vomit every morning, and I got really fat from all the food.
Sumomo
It was just fun back then, feeling like I was really living it up.
Sumomo
But it wasn't like the fun you have taking photographs.
Sumomo
I wonder now what is it that I really wanna do...
Kanna
...
Sumomo
But since I haven't found it yet, I figure I might as well pick up teaching for my mom's sake.
Kanna
To prove that you're taking things seriously?
Sumomo
Yep!
Sumomo
I just have a little more to go! I've never seen anything through to the end before, so that's something!
Sumomo
And that's why... Mmph!

Sumomo twists her hair up and somehow fits it all into a net, then puts on the wig.
Sumomo
I'll just get through it, even if I have to be someone I don't like.
Sumomo
And that's that!

And with that, the conversation is over.

I keep thinking of her words as we continue walking.

And before long, I can't help but want to say something.

Until we reach a crossroads.
Kanna
Can I ask one thing?
Sumomo
Of course! I'm your teacher now!
Kanna
If you died tomorrow, would you have any regrets?
Sumomo
Hmm..
Kanna
Would you live the same day you did today if you knew you'd die tomorrow?
Sumomo
Mmm...
Kanna
Everyone keeps on living like they or the people around them are gonna be alive forever.
Kanna
But I know that's not the case.
Sumomo
Right.
Kanna
That's all.
Sumomo
Mhm.

I turn my back to her and start walking.

After taking a few steps, I stop and turn back.

She's still looking at me.
Kanna
...See you tomorrow.
Sumomo
Yeah! Tomorrow!
Sumomo
...

I take off the wig after seeing him off.

What if I die tomorrow?

Does he even need to ask?

This isn't what I wanna do.

It'll never work out for me, not in a million years.

I know both the teachers and students see me as a huge fraud.

But everyone's smarter than me.

They can keep it together.

There's not much else I can do, is there?

I twirl the wig in my hands.

But...

Someday...

I really wish I could talk with Kanna all the time as my real self. Not pretending to be something I'm not.
Azuki
Hey there, Candy. Pretty late today, eh?
Kanna
Yeah.
Azuki
Where's Bitch?
Kanna
Call her Peach, would you?
Azuki
Hm?
Kanna
Never mind.
Azuki
She ain't coming today?
Kanna
Don't think so.
Azuki
Bummer.
Kanna
...
Azuki
By the by. I know it's a little late to ask, but...
Kanna
Hm?
Azuki
What're you gonna do when the car's fixed?
Kanna
...
Azuki
I mean, you can't drive.
Kanna
I can. I just don't have a license.
Azuki
Hahah! Planning on driving without a license, are you?
Kanna
Yeah?
Azuki
Man, that brings back memories. I used to do that all the time.
Kanna
Really?
Azuki
I drove all over those country roads with no license. Boy, those were the days.
Kanna
Whoa, really?

Seemingly deep in her memory land, Azuki fails to acknowledge my question.

It actually really scares me even thinking of committing such a huge crime, but getting to know a pioneer in that department reassures me a little.
Azuki
The recklessness of youth and candy sweet ideas. You're not half bad.
Azuki
Where do you wanna go? Just travel around?
Kanna
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Azuki
Huh?
Kanna
Haah...

I should've gone and grabbed some stuff this morning.

No, way before that.

But I was too preoccupied with the car.

Now I can finally do what I gotta do.

Even if I wait until my dad's gone tomorrow morning, the result will be pretty much the same.

But...
Kanna
...

I better put my money where my mouth is and do justice to the stuff I told Sumomo earlier.

Don't leave for tomorrow what you can do today.

The lights of the living room are on.

My dad must be in there.

After taking a deep breath, I enter the house.

Sure enough, my dad is in the living room, reading a book.

He looks up when I move into the entrance.

I see his gaze travel up to my forehead for a moment.

He must have noticed the haircut.
Dad
...
Kanna
...
Dad
Hm? What is it?

Dad asks, turning his attention back to his book.
Kanna
I wanna borrow one of the old albums.
Dad
Photo albums?

He raises his head again.

I nod.
Kanna
Where are they?
Dad
Which ones do you need?
Kanna
The ones from when we camped together.
Dad
That's pretty much all of them.
Kanna
...
Dad
Wait right there.
Dad
Here.

Dad goes up to the second floor then comes back with a bag containing about a dozen or so bundles of albums.
Kanna
Thanks.
Dad
Mhm.

After handing me the bag, Dad goes back to the sofa and picks up his book again.
Kanna
...

Is this okay?

I hesitate for a moment, then turn and walk toward the front door.
Dad
Kanna.

He calls out to me, and I turn back.
Kanna
...
Dad
Are you going to class?
Kanna
...Yeah.
Dad
I see.
Kanna
But I'm gonna focus on photography this summer. I... don't know if I'll go on to a specialized course.
Dad
...
Kanna
I'll attend until the end of the semester.
Dad
Mhm.
Kanna
Good night.
Dad
Isn't it hot out in the garage?
Kanna
Yeah. It has good ventilation, though, so it's okay.
Dad
All right.
Kanna
...
Kanna
...

I walk back to the garage, starting to feel the weight of the albums in both of my arms.

...

Was it okay to leave the conversation at that?

Was there more I should have said?

Maybe Dad is thinking the same.

He gave me the albums without asking questions.

...

I really want him to understand.

I want him to know that I'm serious about becoming a photographer.

And if possible, I'd like his support.

This is a new feeling I've never really had before.

Maybe I wouldn't have felt if if I'd just kept being stubborn and not gone to class.

Today was the first time ever where I didn't clam up when trying to talk to Dad.

Maybe...

I could graduate, give up on further study, and say I want to study photography while working.

That would be a compromise...

One I feel like we could both come to terms with now.

But that only means...

This summer is really important.
Azuki
Mm... What's that?
Kanna
Nothing. It's like my homework.
Azuki
Gotcha. You sure got your work cut out for you too, eh?
Kanna
I sure do.

I unpin Mom's sketch from the cork board next to the sink and take it with me.
Kanna
Can I go into the car for a while?
Azuki
Huh? Sure thing.
Kanna
...

I place Mom's sketch on the camper's desk.

Maybe the place is at one of the campsites we visited as a family.

It could be one of the many locations she scouted together with us.

One of them must be the place Mom chose to photograph the comet.

I take the albums out of the bag and pile them up on top of the desk.

I also ready a notepad and a pen.
Kanna
Okay...

First, I need to list out all the places we went.

Then I've got to rule out all the locations that obviously wouldn't work.

After that, I can keep ruling out potential sites one by one by checking regional books at the library.

I'm sure I can find it this way.

Mom's cheeky grin comes to mind.

It must be one of the places I went to with her.

Otherwise, she wouldn't have bothered hiding it from me.

I psych myself up, open the first album, and start looking through our camping pictures.
