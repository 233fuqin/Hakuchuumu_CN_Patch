After today's classes, Sumomo stands at the podium again and does the usual ceremony to finish the day.

That's another day down.

Only one more, and it'll finally be over.

It feels weird coming to class after so much time away.

Did each day always feel this long?

I'm amazed by how everyone can just sit on these chairs for hours on end.

After being out of the school loop for only three months, I feel like I've lost something that comes naturally to everyone else.
Sumomo
As you may know, we have the end of semester ceremony tomorrow. Not long until summer break now.
Sumomo
See you all tomorrow.

My classmates leave the room in a steady stream.

I grab my bag and get ready to leave too.

I want to give Sumomo the photo I printed out yesterday.

After her whole teaching practice thing is over, I might never see her again.

I leave the classroom together with everyone else.

I chase after Sumomo at a light jog.

But then, I hear her voice coming from the landing.
Kanna
Hm?
Sumomo
I'm sorry...
Male Teacher
I'll have you know we get people like you every year. Kids thinking they can become teachers, just like you.
Male Teacher
I'm actually amazed at how useless you are. Don't you think you should be attending classes rather than teaching them?
Sumomo
I'm sorry. I've never been that good at studying...
Sumomo
But there's only one day left, and I was hoping I could pass my evaluation...
Sumomo
But! I, err, I did all I could... I really tried hard, and I...
Sumomo
I thought that'd help me get the note I needed to graduate...
Sumomo
I did everything asked of me, even if it wasn't all perfect.
Male Teacher
What was that?
Sumomo
...

Is she talking about me?

She was happy about her evaluation improving because I came to class.
Sumomo
Nothing... Never mind.
Male Teacher
Your type always wants to be judged on effort alone, regardless of whether you actually achieve anything.
Male Teacher
The process matters squat. It's the result that matters.
Sumomo
But I...
Male Teacher
What?
Sumomo
Nothing... Never mind.

The teacher's footsteps grow fainter as he walks away.
Sumomo
*Sigh*

Sumomo's sad sigh floats down to me.

I look up the stairs.

I catch a glimpse of Sumomo slowly climbing up them.

...

Oh man.

I really am screwed.

I did my best, even dressing up to look the part of whatever they expected of me.

I really tried, in my own way.

But if the process doesn't matter and it's just about results, what about bringing Kanna back?

Do I need to tell them about it to make it clear?
Sumomo
...

Nah, I can't.

To be honest, I did bring him back so I could use it as a bargaining chip.

But it feels like I'm using him as a tool, and I hate that.

Maybe I've gotten too close to him?

Ugh. If I knew this was gonna happen, I wouldn't have made a fool of myself and dragged Kanna into this in the first place.

I follow Sumomo up to the rooftop.

Looking around, I see her leaning against the handrail.
Kanna
...

Taking the photo out of my bag, I walk over to her.
Kanna
Sumomo.
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
Here.
Sumomo
Oh, Kanna. What's this?
Kanna
Take a look.

clearly a little surprised, she accepts the photo from me.
Sumomo
Whoa...
Kanna
Pretty good, right?
Sumomo
Ahahah! Do I really smile like this?
Kanna
When you're in the garage and the terminal, yeah.
Kanna
I haven't seen it once here at the academy, though.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
It's the best photo I've ever taken.
Sumomo
Really?! I'm so happy to hear that.
Kanna
I want to thank you.
Sumomo
Huh? F-For what?
Kanna
My goal has always been to take pictures that make people feel something. That's what makes me happy.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
And ever since I started coming to class, I've been talking a little more with Dad.
Sumomo
Really? Things are better with your daddy now?!
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
Thank goodness! Did you make up?
Kanna
Not quite, I don't think.
Sumomo
Aw. But talking to each other is start!
Kanna
Some good things happened too.
Sumomo
Yeah?
Kanna
Good things that happened because you brought me to class, I mean.
Sumomo
Mm...
Kanna
That's all. After tomorrow, we might not see each other again.
Kanna
So I wanted you to know that.
Kanna
And I wanted you to know that... you have a really nice smile.

I say, as I look down at the picture she's holding.
Sumomo
Thanks.

Sumomo smiles fondly at her own picture.

I see a faint hint of a blush touch her face.

I'm glad I handed her the photo so she can take a good look at herself.
Kanna
I think... you should always look like you do in that photo.
Sumomo
Do you like me better the way I look in this photo?
Kanna
More than now, sure.
Sumomo
Ahahah!

After letting out a hearty laugh, she traces her own smile in the picture.

She's the first person to look at one of my pictures with such passion.

Realizing that the corners of my mouth curling into a dopey grin, I snap back to reality and shake my head.
Kanna
So, I guess I should get going.
Sumomo
Thank you.

She says, as I walk back.

When I turn around, I see her holding my photograph in both hands with a wide smile on her face.
Sumomo
I have some tidying up to do, not to mention I can see some teacher chewing me out again, so I probably won't have time to come by the garage.
Sumomo
So I'll see you tomorrow.

I just answer her with a nod.
Sumomo
...
Sumomo
Man, I sure look like I'm having fun.
Sumomo
I'm just wide open, so he reads me like a book. Is that what Azuki means when she calls me a bitch? Heheh.
Sumomo
Still...
Sumomo
This really is me, huh? The real me...
Kanna
I did it.

After we part in the rooftop, I head straight back home and into Hachimaru.

I'm almost done sorting through the albums now.

At least, I have most of the camp sites we visited together listed out.

There are a few albums still stacked on the desk.

Sticky notes poke out from them.

I'm using them to mark locations I can't remember or identify at all.

I look at my list.

There are less than forty candidates.
Kanna
...

I look at Mom's sketch that I found inside Hachimaru.

She probably drew it with a pencil.

The paper itself is all wavy in places, as if it had gotten wet and then dried out.

Maybe it was out in the mountain air.

Looks like a place with conifers.

It doesn't quite look like a cave, but it looks like a view from some kind of hole.

Where in the world is this place?

I refocus on the albums on my desk.

There's actually someone nearby that remembers all of these places better than me.

My dad.
Kanna
...

Maybe I should go to the house and ask him.

I could save myself all this hassle. He might recognize the place at a glance.

...
Anna
That'll be one surprise for 2061!

I remember her cheeky grin.

A wry smile comes to my own lips.

Asking my dad should be a last resort.

I still have time.

This is the last game between Mom and me.

I take a deep breath.

It'll be fine.

For now at least, things are moving in the right direction.

Hachimaru will be back on the roads soon enough.

It actually was back on them not so long ago.

If I figure out the location, I can have Azuki drive me there.

This plan is actually looking realistic now.

I'll turn to my dad only after I've exhausted all other options.

Then, this summer...

I'll finally show him that I'm not a kid anymore.
Azuki
Ah. Crank out a lot today?
Kanna
Not again!
Azuki
Hahah!
Azuki
Peach isn't coming today?
Kanna
Yeah, the semester ends tomorrow, so she has some stuff to do.
Azuki
Huh.
Kanna
How's the car looking?
Azuki
The chassis is fine. We'd have a real problem on our hands if it were bent.
Kanna
That's good.
Azuki
Maybe I'll go ahead and steal it again while I have the chance, before your summer break starts.
Kanna
You're really starting to piss me off!
Azuki
You've got steam coming out of your ears already.
Kanna
You better not steal it!
Azuki
If I was really trying to steal it, I wouldn't be joking about it.
Azuki
Besides, I don't want some brat burning my house down all over again.
Kanna
...
Azuki
Come on! I ain't gonna steal it!
