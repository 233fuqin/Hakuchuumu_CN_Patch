Kaito
Could you show me around the rest of the place?

She nods dutifully in response.
Izumo
I will show you the bathroom.
Kaito
*Sigh*

The bathroom turned out to be a simple shower room with an attached changing room.

I sit down on the bed.

This place is so strange.

Does that Yonagi girl have some kind of impediment?

There's a disparity between the impression she gives off and her actions that I can't quite reconcile.

Mentally, she seems really young.

There are two beds in the room and a single basin.

Above the basin, a simple mirror is fixed to the wall.

I stand in front of it and take a good look at myself.
Kaito
