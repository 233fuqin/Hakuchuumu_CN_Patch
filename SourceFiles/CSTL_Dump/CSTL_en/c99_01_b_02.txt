The room Izumi guides me to is filled with children's toys and board games.

And in the middle of it, Yonagi is...
Kaito
Dolls?
Izumo
It seems so, yes.

She's playing with dolls, holding one in each hand so that they're facing each other.

I slowly approach her.

She looks up at me as I come closer.
Kaito
Are they talking to each other?
Yonagi
...Yes.
Kaito
Is it fun?

She nods.
Yonagi
Pow pow pow.
Yonagi
Paw paw paw.

The doll in her left hand is chasing after the one in her right hand.

I wonder if there's any story behind it.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Yonagi
Bonk.

The doll on the left seems to have caught up with the other one.
Kaito
Why is it chasing the other?
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Oh?
Izumo
It seems like she's focused on playing.
Kaito
...She's just like a kid.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
...
