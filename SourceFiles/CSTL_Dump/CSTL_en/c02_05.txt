Rob
Oi, where did Will go?
Olivia
We went to get some salt upstairs. He is taking long, isn't he?
Father
Maybe he's lazying around?
Olivia
We're closing already, so it's the same, but why is Will resting while I'm busting my arse here?

I grab the closed sign and walk to the entrance.

But then...
Olivia
Oh...
Rob
Huh? Oh...

A woman walks into the pub.

There's something familiar about her.

I stare at her face for a moment.

She gives me a small, timid smile.

I remember that smile.
Olivia
You're...

The woman from that night.

The one I crossed paths with on my way to the manor.

It's definitely her.

I just know it.

A rush of joy courses through me.

Ever since then, I've been curious about what kind of person she is.
Olivia
Are you alone?

She nods.
Olivia
Are you okay with a bar seat? Please, come in.

I watch the woman as she walks to the counter.

She's no ordinary person.

I realize that straight away.

That's the gait of a person who stands upon the stage.

Her movements are so graceful and ingrained that they blend into her everyday motions.

It's something only another actor would notice.

I want it.

I want her in my troupe.

Holding back my excitement, I go behind the counter.
Olivia
What would you like to drink? I'll join you. We ladies should enjoy a cup or two together.

Still silent, the woman points to a bottle of aqua vitae on the shelf.

It's a strong spirit that we recently got in stock.

She gracefully places a shilling on the counter.
Olivia
You want to buy the whole bottle?

She nods.

She manages to make even that nod look like the most beautiful thing.
Olivia
I see you have good taste. Well then.

I take two glasses and pour the thick tawny liquid into them.
Olivia
Say, why don't we play a game? Whoever can drink the other under the counter has to do whatever the winner says.

The woman's eyes glimmer with a mysterious light when I say that.

A smile touches her lips.

It seems like she finds the idea amusing.

She takes her glass and raises it in front of me.
Olivia
To our meeting tonight.

We clink our glasses together.

The hard spirit burns its way down my throat.

It's stronger than I expected.

I try to remember the number of cups of ale I shared with customers today.

I stopped counting at some point.

If I knew this was gonna happen, I would have stayed sober.

I feel the tension mounting in me after the first drink.

I take short, shallow breaths so the heat doesn't show in my face.

The woman is already waiting for a refill, her glass set on the counter.
Olivia
...
Rob
Heheh, talk about an elegant way to pick a quarrel.
Olivia
This is not a quarrel, and I'd appreciate it if you kept your comments to yourself.
Rob
Hey, Olivia! You're not looking so good, lass!
Olivia
I'll sew your mouth shut!

By the time I lose count of how many cups we've shared, my stomach is ready to regurgitate everything I forced into it.

But I manage to suppress the impulse somehow.

I'm at my limit.

I can't control my breathing either.

My breaths feel warm and damp.

To think there's a woman alive who can drink more than me!

No...

If I was sober, it wouldn't even have been a contest.
Olivia
You are...
Olivia
...pretty good.

Olivia's eyes are still steady.

I drain the liquor poured into my glass.

When I put it down back to the counter, some liquid still remains in Olivia's glass.

I smile, snatch that glass, and drink the remaining liquor in it.
Olivia
Ah...

Olivia's face is a mix of bewilderment and frustration.
Olivia
...I get it, I lost. I'm amazed by how much you can drink, truly.
Olivia
And you're so beautiful... Please, would you tell me your name?

I stare right into her eyes.

I can't take it anymore.

I burst into laughter right in front of her face.
Olivia
Huh?

Her eyes bulge out in absolute astonishment.

Rob freezes in his seat as realization dawns upon him.
Will
I don't think I need to give my name, do I?
Rob
Oh, Lord...
Olivia
Will?

I nod cheerfully.

For a moment, joy and excitement flicker across her face.

...Only to be replaced by absolute rage and an inferno in her eyes.
Will
Ah...

Olivia raises her right arm slowly.

And delivers the strongest slap yet, directly to my face.

It takes but a second for the pain to spread throughout my skull.
Will
Wh-What was that for?!
Olivia
You impertinent little runt!
Olivia
You, a bloody slave! How dare you deceive me! How dare you!
Rob
Ahahahah!
Father
What? What's happening?
Rob
Hear this, Boss! Thought we had a real beauty here, but they turned out to be your son!
Father
What in the world do you mean, Rob?
Rob
Exactly what I said, ahahah!
Olivia
You impertinent runt... Impudent rascal! You're my slave!
Olivia
But... But....
Olivia
That was splendid, Will. Well done, you performed most magnificently...
Olivia
...
Rob
And she's wasted.
Will
Hahah, this is new.
Will
I wasn't joking when I said I wouldn't have lost if I was sober last time.

I lay my hand on her head where it rests on the counter.

It's surprisingly petite, I notice.
Rob
Ah, those are the clothes you asked me for, right?
Will
Yeah, you didn't notice?
Rob
I didn't even look at them. Don't have any business looking at women's clothing.
Father
My boy, are you crossdressing?
Will
Yeah.
Father
Ahahah! How I wish my eyes could see this!
Rob
Boss, his beauty is no laughing matter, I tell you!
Rob
It's like we have two Olivias in here.

I feel a bitter smile creep up on my face.

That would only make sense.

I stole from Olivia to create this woman.
Father
Ahahahah! This only gets better and better! Are you embarrassed, son?
Will
It was embarrassing at first. But our troupe has to beat Marlowe, and this is what I need to do.
Will
I can't afford to let myself be frozen into inaction by embarrassment.
Rob
Heh...
Will
And...

I turn to Olivia, who's sleeping soundly, facedown on the counter.
Will
Olivia has done nothing but help me since the day we met. I want to live up to her expectations at least once.
Father
I see now.
Rob
I don't even feel like making banter about it now, boohoo. Time to pour myself a drink.
Father
Serve one for me too, good man!
Rob
Not a chance in hell, Boss! You stay put!
Father
Curses...

I lay the drunk Olivia on my bed and go to my desk.

I can hear her peaceful, even breathing.

I stare at her for a moment.

Peacefully asleep like this, she looks like an entirely different person.

It reminds me of watching my mother sleep in that same bed when I was a child.
Will
...

The script for Hamlet lies on top of my desk.

His revenge is the mouthpiece for my anger.

And now, he's aiming that anger against his own mother.

I feel like something's off.

The ghost of his father.

His uncle, who stole his mother from him.

And Hamlet himself.

I don't feel like the mother should be at the center of this revenge story.

But that same mother decided to start sleeping with the brother of her husband immediately following his death.

Surely Hamlet would see that as the weakness of women manifested in her.

But...

"Being able to recognize your weakness is the first step in forgiving weakness in others."
Will
...

I remember Ed's words.

I feel like I finally understand what he meant by that now.

Yes, Hamlet's obsessive self-questioning lays all his weaknesses bare.

And at the end...
Will
He... forgives her?

His dead father.

Murdered by his own uncle.

He wants revenge for this injustice.

It's simple.

And in that mad rush for vengeance, his mother ends up dead.

But that wasn't what he wanted.

A sliver of forgiveness dwelt inside his heart.

And that... is the biggest of tragedies.
Will
...

The deadline is creeping up on me.

And the person who imposed that unreasonable deadline is snoring away on my bed right now.
Will
No rest for the wicked, I guess.

I mutter to myself as I let my quill flow across the paper.

Next morning.

Leaving Olivia to sleep, I go downstairs to arrange the chairs in the pub before taking a nap.

I wake up feeling faint aches here and there.

And here I thought I had completely healed from that savage beating the watchmen gave me.

A wry smile on my face, I get up, slip behind the counter, and begin doing the morning prep.

After a while, I hear the steps of someone coming down the stairs.

It's Olivia, the color strangely drained from her face.
Will
Good morning. How are you feeling?

She stares at me, her breathing ragged.

Her pale complexion could be due to a hangover.

Maybe her blood flow isn't so good.

But somehow, I feel like that's not the whole story.
Olivia
...What time is it?
Will
Huh? Almost noon, I think?
Olivia
...

Olivia frowns, and her expression hardens.
Will
Are you still mad at me? I know it was sneaky of me to deceive you, but I—
Olivia
I'm leaving. I can't help you with prep today, sorry.
Will
Huh?

Olivia walks to the door at a swift pace and throws it open.
Will
Hey! What about rehearsal?!

By the time the words leave my mouth, she's already gone.
Will
What's her problem?
Olivia
Hah, hah...

I was careless.

I relaxed my guard completely.

I always have to be back before Spencer finishes having his fun for the night.

And just when I finally saw a flicker of hope for the troupe.

How could I have endured so scrupulously up until today...

Only to slip and fall now?

My head is throbbing.

The drinks from yesterday pool heavily in my stomach.

I can smell them on my breath.

But there's no time for me to wait to sober up completely.

Maybe Spencer decided to play around until noon today.

I can but hope that's the case.

I run down the streets to the manor while pulling up my messy hair and tying it into a ponytail.
Olivia
Hah, hah...

Stepping into the entryway, I take a minute to get my breath back.

A butler comes over with a cloth, and I use it to wipe my sweat.
Olivia
Is Lord Spencer in his room?

The butler nods.

I bite my lower lip in frustration.

I didn't make it in time.
Olivia
Okay, thank you.

I take a deep breath and head to his room.
Spencer
Hmm? Who goes there?
Olivia
Olivia. May I enter?
Spencer
Ah, Olive. Esta bien, come in.

Upon entering, I see Spencer lying on the bed with a woman and a man snuggling up against him on each side.

They're all undressed.

The scent gives it away.

He bought these two last night, and has been indulging in them the whole night long.
Olivia
I am terribly sorry. I failed to perform my duties this morning.
Spencer
Yes, you certainly did.
Spencer
It's fine. This chico and chica kept me company in your stead.
Spencer
It was quite pleasurable indeed. Especially this chico's little amigo...

Spencer reaches out to the handsome man on his left, pure ecstasy lacing his smile.
Olivia
I'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself, my Lord.
Spencer
Olive, I hear you're outside the manor a lot these days.
Olivia
...Yes. I am focused on being selected for the court's performance, so all my time is going into theatrical training.
Spencer
Your breath stinks.
Olivia
I am terribly sorry. I drank a little too much with the other troupe members.
Spencer
Drinking is fine, the problema arises when you stand before me completely drunk. Too much is too much, little Olive.
Olivia
I will be more careful from now on.
Spencer
I will forgive you, since I myself let my sentidos become drunk on these two. But there will be no mercy next time, are we in agreement?
Olivia
I understand very well.
Spencer
Okay, then this conversation is over. Aah, but one more thing. I have decided on an abode in the Nuevo Mundo.
Spencer
I will journey there this coming autumn. I will need to make new connections in social gatherings, thus I will need an esposa. You know where I'm going with this?
Olivia
...Yes.
Spencer
\\f-7;Do make up your mind while there's tiempo. It will be meaningless if I don't own you while there is still beauty in you. Let one wrinkle appear on that linda face of yours, and I will dispose of you like the refuse you are, understood?

I bow silently.

Then I proceed to leave the room swiftly.

I can hear Spencer's lascivious moans from the other side of the door.

He must still be trying to satiate that inexhaustible desire of his with those two.

A sigh leaves my lips.

My head is still above my shoulders, at least for now.

But nothing has been solved, not really.

There is only one way out for me.

To be selected for the court performance, show our ability, and be put under the patronage of the Royal Household.

If I am to continue acting...

I will have to speak into the ear of the Queen and influence the Royal Household, so that the laws themselves can be changed.

I have no other choice.

Now that we're being ruled by a Queen who is sympathetic towards theater, this is my chance.

After finishing getting ready, I head to the theater.

Olivia is there before me, and rehearsal starts as per usual, but...
Olivia
Stop! Will, you're good. You've improved a great deal. Thomas, Kiki, your performances are abhorrent!
Olivia
I struggle to find anything more crude and vulgar than seeing you flapping about on stage!
Olivia
Kiki, Helena has never wanted for food. She may not be popular with men, but it's not like she was raised in a barn.
Kiki
Yes, ma'am...
Olivia
She's not a petty thief like you, so try to act the part!
Kiki
Yes, ma'am...
Olivia
You too, Thomas. Puck the fairy may be shrewd, but he's not evil.
Olivia
Have you seen yourself in a mirror? You look like wickedness itself put on clothes and started walking around.
Thomas
Yes, ma'am...
Olivia
You need to change your very way of life. Acting is not a bloody game! It's too late for you to pretend you're something else, so change your life instead.
Kiki&Thomas
Yes, ma'am...
Will
...

Her orders are more nonsensical and erratic than before.

Her face is still pale, and her breath still stinks of alcohol if you're close enough.

Sometimes she puts a hand to her head, no doubt nursing a headache.

It feels like she's lashing out with her anger at the rest of the troupe members.
Olivia
Will.
Will
Yes?
Olivia
Your movements are good, they catch the eye. They fit with the overall flow of the scenes and don't disrupt them, though I would expect that from the play's author.
Olivia
Practice your lines a little more. Keep imitating me if that's what you're going for.
Olivia
It'd be good if you could make your voice a little higher, but try not to overdo it.
Olivia
It'll get easier with practice.
Will
All right.

Surprisingly, her advice to me is far more constructive.

It looks like she's capable of giving meaningful advice to those who surpass her standards.

The problem, as I see it, is that those standards are too high.
Olivia
We'll take a five minute break. When we're done, let's start this scene again from the top.

No one says anything.
Olivia
Understood?!
Kiki&Thomas
Yes, ma'am.
Will
...

I chase after Olivia as she walks backstage.
Will
Olivia.
Olivia
What?

Her rose irises shine from her narrowed eyes.

Managing not to falter in the face of her piercing gaze, I voice my request.
Will
Can I sit and watch the rehearsal today?
Olivia
You're not gonna participate?

I shake my head.
Olivia
Why not? I know you've improved a fair bit, but you already took plenty time off when you got hurt.
Olivia
You're already healed from that, aren't you? Are you hungover?
Will
No, I just want to see the troupe as a whole perform.
Will
I want to see them as fully and objectively as possible from a distance. It's impossible to see everything properly while on the stage.
Olivia
What for?
Will
We barely have any time until the premiere. What's gonna happen if things keep going as they are right now? I'm sure you're aware nothing good's gonna come of this.
Olivia
...

Olivia sighs while holding her head.

Looks like hangovers hit her hard.

I know that pain well myself.
Olivia
Just for today, then. Otherwise the rest of the troupe might try to pull the same move as an excuse to skip out on rehearsals.
Will
That will be enough. Thanks.
Olivia
Just try to actually come up with something useful from it, understood?

After the break, I move back from the group to a distance where I can watch them perform as a whole.

As always, Olivia's watching in front of the stage, instructing everyone about their movements.

If there's anything that deviates from her instructions, she stops the practice on the spot.

The member that made the mistake is thoroughly scolded, while the others simply stare into the distance with vacant eyes.

When she gets mad at Thomas, his eyes meet Kiki's and he makes a flippant gesture with his hand.

For a moment, I shudder.

But Olivia seems oblivious as she keeps shouting in his face.
Will
I see.

She finishes grilling Thomas after a while.

He seems to have internalized the movements Olivia instructed, in his own way.

After a long pause, they resume the rehearsal.

Not from the beginning, but from the point where she stopped them.

They can't possibly memorize the flow of the scene after an interruption like that.

I try connecting the first half with the second in my head.

It's all messed up even for me, so I imagine it must be worse for them.
Olivia
Stop! Kiki! You're all over the place! Come here!
Kiki
Yes, ma'am.
Thomas
Heheh, serves you right.
Will
Goodness.

The rehearsal is over, and the rest of the troupe leaves with sagged shoulders and tired expressions.

Rather than relief at it being over, they all seem to be weighed down by the fact that they'll have to endure the same thing all over again tomorrow.

...The play's supposed to be a comedy, mind you.
Olivia
So, how did it look from afar? Learn anything?
Will
Yeah. Many things, in fact.
Olivia
You don't say.
Will
Let's talk at the pub. We still have time before we open up.
Will
The first thing I learned is that if things continue this way, we don't have a hope of beating Marlowe come premiere day.
Will
It's not about each actor as an individual; we're not organized as a group.
Olivia
So?

Olivia's staring into my eyes.
Will
Right now, most of the rehearsal time is eaten away by you scolding anyone that makes a mistake.
Will
Not that your guidance isn't helping them.
Will
There is always visible change in the members that you scold. That's quite remarkable.
Olivia
I do have experience dealing with rebellious slaves. How ironic.
Will
Yeah, ironic indeed.
Will
Currently, the person who needs to change their attitude the most is...
Will
...you, Olivia.

Her rose eyes flare with anger and indignation.
Will
Ironic, isn't it?
Olivia
For your own well being, I hope this is not just some joke at my expense.

I shake my head.
Olivia
Explain yourself.
Will
Let me go through some points. First of all, the way you're going about things right now is woefully inefficient.
Will
Do you remember how many full scenes we rehearsed today?
Olivia
...
Will
And it's not just today. It's been this way ever since the scripts were handed out. The only time we've been able to make it to the last line...
Will
...was during the first group reading.
Olivia
But there are mistakes that can't be overlooked! I have no choice but to stop them!
Will
Let's exchange putting on a play for making clothes, and think of it from that perspective.
Will
Right now, you're fussing over the placement of every single button on your blouse.
Olivia
God is in the details. Isn't that a saying you bards like to invoke?
Will
But we haven't even started to work on the trousers! No matter how perfectly placed the buttons on your blouse are, everyone will laugh if you go out in your knickers!
Olivia
...
Will
In fact, the more beautiful the buttons are, the more ridiculous the whole situation appears.
Olivia
I've had it with your damn analogies! Move on!
Will
No matter how ill-fitting or dirty the clothes we wear are, we must first be fully clothed before we can even step onto the stage.
Olivia
I get what you're saying. Now tell me your solution.
Will
We need time to run through the whole rehearsal without any interruptions. At the beginning of the day and at the end.
Will
With this play, I think we can manage it. For scripts with longer acts, they can be separated by curtain calls.
Olivia
...
Will
During the intermissions between acts, you can come in. You can grill them relentlessly for their mistakes as much as you want, just like always.
Olivia
As things stand, I'll have to memorize so many things to point out that my head will explode.
Olivia
You truly are an armchair critic, huh? Your ideas must sound so easy and obvious in your head.
Will
Let's agree on a simple sign you can make for me to look out for. I'll remember for you.
Olivia
I will have at least a hundred corrections to remember.
Will
I'll memorize them all. I promise.
Olivia
Can you truly do such a thing?

I nod.
Will
I'm confident. Let's at least give it a try.
Olivia
Suit yourself.
Will
And...
Olivia
You still have more to say?!
Will
You're stunting the troupe members with your criticism. It's fine if you have to force yourself to do it, but please look for something good in each person's performance and praise them for it.
Olivia
What?! Why must I be mindful of the egos of you bunch of rabble?!
Will
Because you're the leader of this troupe.
Olivia
Then why don't they try obeying orders and acting as I instruct them to?!
Will
You're talking about what a slave would do.
Olivia
Same thing! Why, you're all my bloody slaves!
Will
Even if that's true, I think you should forget that during rehearsals.
Olivia
Why would I do such a thing?! Slaves get no rest!
Will
Does the audience come to see a troupe of slaves? I don't think so, do you?
Olivia
...
Will
If there is no trust between the leader of the troupe and the actors, it'll all be for naught. Do you want the troupe to be chosen for the court performance or not?
Will
Do you want to whip slaves, or do you want to train actors? Think twice before answering that.
Olivia
I've had enough of sitting here and hearing you prattle on and on.
Will
I think you've interjected quite a lot, actually.
Olivia
Silence!
Olivia
Trust, you say? Don't make me laugh! Do you think I don't know what all of them whisper behind my back?!
Olivia
If they want bloody trust, then how about they show themselves deserving of it first?! Do not demand what you don't give!
Will
Olivia.
Olivia
What?!
Will
I could say those exact same words to you.
Olivia
Ngh!
Will
Let's just give it a try tomorrow, please.
Will
You want to do this for the last showing of the Jew of Malta, right? We have no time to lose.
Olivia
I won't stand for this!
Will
Stand for what?
Olivia
You spouting rhetoric with that smug look on your face! I won't stand for you making me look like the irrational one here!
Olivia
Besides, how many times have you called me by name today?! Did you forget your due respect?! It's Lady Olivia to you!
Will
I forgot.
Olivia
This is my bloody troupe! I will decide how we rehearse, and no one else! Don't get ahead of yourself.
Will
Okay, what do you want to do?
Olivia
...

Olivia's breathing is ragged, and her lips quiver from all the shouting.
Olivia
Let's try the method you suggested.

Olivia murmurs, each word physically paining her.

After we close up the pub, I go upstairs to keep working on Hamlet's script.

I can see the end already in sight.

Hamlet's revenge tragedy begins from a dialogue with the ghost of his father.

He plays the part of a madman while he plots his revenge.

But the feigned madness gets a hold of him and consumes him. The line between sanity and madness blurs.

He keeps questioning his sanity, but no answer is awarded to him.

In the end, he loses both his mother and the woman he loved.

And he himself is dragged to the eternal sleep.
Will
...

Hamlet is me.

The parts of myself that want revenge.

But...
Will
Your death shan't be in vain.

This tragedy is indeed worth telling.

Someone has to tell this story.

For all those souls across the country that burn with the fire of hatred and the need for revenge, just like me.

At death's door...

Hamlet entrusts it all to a friend.

So that no one else repeats his selfsame mistakes.

If you let yourself be consumed by revenge, you will lose sight of what matters most.

That's why the closing line will be...

Thou livest; report me and my cause aright. In this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, to tell my story. Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause.

I cannot live to hear the News from England. On you, he has my dying voice.

The rest, is silence...
Olivia
Starting today, we'll be changing up how we do these rehearsals.

At the start of the next day's rehearsal, Olivia addresses the troupe.
Kiki
Huh?
Thomas
Why?
Olivia
Will, you explain.
Will
Err, why me?
Olivia
This is your bright idea, is it not? Explain it yourself.

Olivia says as she takes a step back.

Everyone's eyes are on me.
Will
So...
Kiki
So when we run through the play at the beginning and end of the day, the leader won't stop us in the middle of a scene, even if we make a mistake?
Thomas
Even if we fumble our lines? Even if we move wrong?
Will
Exactly. I just want you to focus on performing the full scenes until the end.
Kiki
Are you serious?!
Thomas
We won't get yelled at even if we mess up?!
Will
Just remember that when the scene is over, she'll go over all the mistakes and correct you.
Thomas
Almost had me there for a second. Go over mistakes? We're gonna get yelled at again.
Kiki
We're still gonna get grilled at the end.
Olivia
Of course. What's the point of rehearsal if you don't get told what to improve upon?
Kiki
...
Olivia
Understood?
Kiki
Yes, ma'am.
Olivia
You too.
Thomas
Yes, ma'am.
Will
Well, it's better than feeling like you're walking on eggshells the whole time. I want to see how the play comes together as a whole.
Olivia
...
Will
...Lady Olivia wants to see how it comes together, I mean.
Kiki
Oh well, we're just here to do as we're told.
Kiki
If that's what you want, we'll do it.
Thomas
Yeah, let's get it out of the way.
Olivia
Okay, if everyone's on the same page, let's begin.
Will
Yeah.

Now, this approach is supposed to  help us visualize exactly what we're working with...
Olivia
...
Hermia
...Hey, Lysander.
Lysander
Huh?
Hermia
Say your line.
Lysander
There, gentle Hermia, my love for thee is eternal! May I marry thee?
Hermia
My good Lysander!  I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow. To-morrow truly will I meet with thine, and our eternal will become!
Puck
Phew, that's one pair down.
Helena
Ah, Demetrius. Finally, my love for thee has made thee see the light!
Lysander
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past. Perhaps we were blessed with everlasting love by the summer's court over this midsummer night.
Helena
Oh, Demetrius. Ne'er leave my side once more!
Lysander
Let us go, Hermia. Before the morrow our vows will be sealed!
Hermia
Y-Yes, my love!
Puck
Why, then, finally all are awake! No more yielding but a dream, a gift, they say! Truly, all they did was have a silly midsummer night's dream! Courtesy of yours truly!
Will
...
Kiki
...
Olivia
...
Will
...So, this is the end, right?
Kiki
Maybe?
Olivia
A break... We need a break. Will, you remember everything, right?
Will
Y-Yeah.

Last night we agreed on a signal for her to make.

She used it liberally during the performance.
Olivia
Prepare yourselves. I will thoroughly whip you into shape even if it takes me until morning. Understood?
Kiki
Oh no...
Thomas
Are we gonna be okay?
Will
I'd say this is a big step for her. Not jumping on every single mistake she sees and all.
Kiki
You think so? She was shivering with barely repressed anger just now, I think.
Thomas
Her face looked like a tomato and all.
Will
Well, at least we got through the whole thing to the end. Baby steps.
Olivia
Never have I seen such a vulgar fairy before! Fix it right now!
Thomas
Yes, ma'am.
Olivia
Kiki! Could your delivery get more deadpan?! Would it kill you to try to put some feeling into your lines?!
Olivia
And you're too short!
Kiki
Err, not much I can do about that. I drink my milk every day, but it doesn't make much difference.
Olivia
Don't talk back!
Kiki
Yes, ma'am.
Will
This is a mess...
Olivia
Your eyes are red, Will! You need to sleep! And I can still hear a boyish tone in your lines!
Will
I can't sleep because you told me to—
Olivia
Shut up! Everything's wrong! Absolutely everything!
Will
Ah, can I say something too?
Olivia
What?!

All the troupe members turn their anxious gazes on me.
Will
Generally speaking, it's bad. Pretty damn bad. I can admit that.
Will
But I've realized some things.
Will
Perhaps the way you point out mistakes isn't the most constructive. Maybe you could stand to improve your approach.
Kiki
Huh?
Thomas
Why would you pour oil onto the pyre?
Olivia
Oh, do enlighten me. But do know that I'll have you torn apart limb from limb if I don't like what you have to say.
Will
In my scene, when Hermia and Lysander elope and spend the night in the forest.
Olivia
...
Will
Remember what you told me about Hermia?
Olivia
Do you understand? Hermia has stood against her father for the first time. This naive, noble maiden has left her house to spend the night in the woods to be together with her beloved!
Olivia
She spends the night fretting over whether he'll hold her in his arms and return her love! She has never felt this strongly in her whole life! And, at dawn, this man tells her that he loves another woman!
Will
This is the first night she's spent outside her parents' home. You said she was a maiden assaulted by a mixture of expectation and anxiety over whether the man she loves will take her or not.
Will
Do you remember?
Olivia
I do. Your point?
Will
If you look at this scene on its own, that's how it appears. And that certainly adds to its feel as a human drama.
Will
But this is a comedy, is it not? If we try to emphasize that angle, won't Hermia look a little too pitiful to the audience?
Olivia
...
Will
In other words, if we want to take into account how this scene contributes to the general flow of the play overall...
Will
Maybe it'd be better if we didn't focus the performance on her conflicted feelings, right?
Will
It may come across as too straightforward, but I think that Hermia being more confident and cocky in this scene will add to the hilarity of it later on.
Kiki
...

Kiki and Thomas alternate between looking at me and at Olivia.
Will
So maybe Hermia should be more confident. Make it clear that she thinks that she has her beloved Lysander in the palm of her hand.
Will
And then, when the next day comes and she's confronted with Lysander's change of heart, Hermia loses her composure and goes into a fit of rage.
Will
Wouldn't that be funnier and elicit the reaction we want out of the audience?
Thomas
Lose her composure? So... like our leader here today?
Kiki
Pfft!
Olivia
...
Will
Until now, we've been practicing each scene separately, so this is happening all over.
Will
I think you and I, as troupe leader and playwright, need to discuss more about the characterization and how the performances will reflect it.
Will
What do you think?
Olivia
...
Kiki
...
Thomas
...
Olivia
We're...
Kiki
...
Thomas
...
Olivia
...done for today.

Kiki and Thomas' eyes bulge out in sheer surprise.
Olivia
...
Will
...

We go back to the pub, exchanging nary a word on the way.
Will
Are you okay?
Olivia
What do you mean?
Will
it's just that, well...
Olivia
I can't stand it.
Will
Huh?
Olivia
It's like I'm talking to a different person. It's beyond vexing!
Will
Eh?
Olivia
If you had such good insights, how about coming out with them from the start instead of losing us time, you simpleton?!
Will
O-Oh, sorry?
Olivia
So, what now?!
Will
Huh?
Olivia
How do I direct them?! Tell me already! That's what you've been thinking about, right?!

We talk until it's time for the pub to open, and again when it's time to close.

During those two intervals, I tell her my plan for the play's production.
Olivia
I see. So this is how you envisioned the story inside your head.
Olivia
I'm sorry, there were parts I honestly didn't grasp on my own. But yes, this is a much better way to go about it.
Olivia
By simplifying the emotions of each character, the overall feeling of the play will become more intricate as a whole.
Will
Making them laugh in the theater is our first priority. The ironic themes of the story...
Will
They'll come to them later in the night, when they're gathered at a pub just like this, discussing it over food and ale.
Will
When you took me to the square to watch the plays of the shopping district...
Will
I realized I should imagine and take into account the kind of life the viewers lead and design a theater-going experience that speaks to them.

Olivia stares at me, disbelief written all over her face, simply nodding in response.
Olivia
I see...
Will
And...
Will
At this point, my script only consists of dialogue.

Olivia nods.
Will
Maybe I should start writing stage directions too. It'll make things easier for the actors.
Will
It'll be clearer for everyone if I add instructions about movements and delivery in between the lines.
Olivia
No, I think it's fine as it is.
Olivia
By reading just the line first, I can create an unbiased image of how it should be in my mind.
Olivia
Then we can amalgamate both our ideas to create something even better.

I nod in response.
Olivia
That way, even if our scripts happen to be stolen, no one will be able to produce the play quite like we will.
Olivia
It can be a kind of assurance for us.
Olivia
Our very own playwright is participating as an actor, so there's no need to bother writing it down.
Olivia
We can keep the information to ourselves.
Will
That's a good idea.
Olivia
Now that we know about the discrepancies between our own personal visions for the play, from here on out we should make sure to discuss the direction from the very beginning.

I nod again.
Will
But everything I came up with is still just in my head, like you said.
Olivia
I did? Me? Really?

I nod.
Will
I haven't considered the individuality of each member of the troupe at all.
Will
I don't know what kind of people they are. That's why I want to leave that judgement to you, leader.
Olivia
I know them as much as you, which is to say, not much at all.

I blink at her.

She maintains a blank expression.
Olivia
I don't even know where they live.
Will
Why not?
Olivia
Why would I need to? I don't concern myself with the lives of my slaves. Isn't that natural?
Will
Wait a minute, then why have you wormed your way into my life to the point that you spend almost the entire day with me?
Olivia
You are irreplaceable. I can hardly keep you out of my sight, can I now?
Olivia
All the other members, I could replace anytime.
Will
Err, I'm sure they can tell you feel that way.
Olivia
Perhaps. I make no effort to hide my disdain.
Will
Do you think that attitude will make them feel motivated to act? I'm asking you as the leader of this whole thing.
Olivia
I mean, they're slaves. What? Are you gonna complain about that too?
Will
Didn't I already tell you that's the wrong way to deal with them? Have you ever gone for a drink with Kiki or Thomas or any of them?

Her eyes widen in surprise and her expression contorts in indignation.
Olivia
Why would I ever spend time with that rabble?! Of course I've never done such a thing!
Will
Olivia.
Olivia
What?!
Will
Summon them all here tomorrow, and treat them to drinks with your own money.
Olivia
Why would I ever?!
Will
Because it'll benefit the troupe. Even if it doesn't, it can't get any worse than it already is.
Will
We have no time, and you need to get to know your whole troupe. At the very least make an effort toward it.
Olivia
...
Will
Understood?
Olivia
...
Will
Lady Olivia?
Olivia
Damn it all! Fine!
Father
Heheh...

Sitting at his usual corner of the bar, my father simply listens to us with a pleasant smile on his face.
