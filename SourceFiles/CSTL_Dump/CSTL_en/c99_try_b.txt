Olivia's memory lingers in my mind.

That confident smile of hers.

I'm sure it's as much Yonagi's confidence as it is Olivia's.

In both this world—

And the dream world—

I'm the only one who can be by her side.

I'm the only one who can fulfill her unreasonable demands.

I clench my fists, a mixture of frustration and determination filling my being.
