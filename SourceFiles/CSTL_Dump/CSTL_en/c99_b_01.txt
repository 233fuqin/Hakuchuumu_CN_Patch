After eating the porridge made for us by Izumo, Yonagi and I head to the recreation room.

Yonagi goes over to one of the shelves and comes back with a pen and notebook in hand.
Yonagi
I am writing a novel.
Kaito
Really?
Yonagi
Yes.
Kaito
What kind of novel?
Yonagi
Hmm... I'm not sure.

I can see the gears turning in her head as she looks at the blank page with a smile playing around her lips.
Yonagi
So there's a boy and a girl. They're both sleeping in a white room.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
And the girl...
Yonagi
She wants to talk to the boy, but she can't talk very well.
Kaito
...

What she's describing...

Is our situation right now.
Kaito
Why?
Yonagi
Hm?
Kaito
Why can't the girl talk?
Yonagi
Didn't you hear me? They're sleeping in the white room.
Kaito
Huh?
Kaito
But the boy's sleeping in that room too, right? Why can't they talk?

She slowly shakes her head.
Yonagi
The girl is sleeping in a much whiter place much, muuuch deeper down.
Yonagi
She's not really in the room.
Yonagi
She can see a lot of things from there, but she can't get out.
Yonagi
...She can't do anything but watch.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
That's the story.
Kaito
Is it a sad story?
Yonagi
Mhm...
Kaito
...

Yonagi keeps staring at the notebook, deep in thought.
Yonagi
Only the end is sad. But the whole story before that is happy. Very happy.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
Will you write something too?
Kaito
Me?
Yonagi
Yes.
Kaito
I... don't think I could.
Yonagi
Really?
Kaito
Somehow, I don't think I've ever written before.
Yonagi
But it's fun.

She says, pressing the end of the pen to her lips and jiggling her legs up and down.
Kaito
You're having fun?
Yonagi
Yeah.
Kaito
I'm glad.
