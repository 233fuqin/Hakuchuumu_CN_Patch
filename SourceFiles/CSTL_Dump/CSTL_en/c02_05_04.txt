Olivia
Everyone, can I have your attention before we begin the rehearsal?
Kiki
Huh?
Thomas
What is it?
Olivia
I have good news and bad news, which one do you want to hear first?
Kiki
Uhhh, how about just the good news?
Thomas
Agreed.

The rest of the troupe members nod in agreement.
Olivia
All right. The good news is that Will finished his new play. We'll start rehearsing today.
Kiki
T-Today?!
Thomas
Huh? We got the second performance today, don't we?
Kiki
The Midsummer Night's Dream one!
Olivia
Yes, but we will be premiering the new one in ten days.
Olivia
Its title is Hamlet. It's a story about the Danish royal family.
Olivia
The melancholic, indecisive, shilly-shallying nature of the protagonist is simply the best. Why, it even reminds me of how a certain someone used to be.

Olivia glances my way with a mocking grin.
Olivia
The leading role, Hamlet, will be mine. As part of my research for the character, I'd like to keep a close eye on a questionable man such as him.
Will
I may not be able to help you there.
Olivia
Oh, what a tragedy.
Olivia
Will, you will be Ophelia. Hamlet's lover, a girl who goes mad because of Hamlet's thirst for revenge.
Will
Right.
Olivia
Thomas, you will be Ophelia's father, the Lord Chamberlain Polonius. He's an incompetent man who boasts of his strong prejudice. You can play him as a comical character.
Olivia
So, just be your usual self.
Thomas
That stings!
Olivia
Kiki, you will be Horatio, Hamlet's best friend. It's the role of a man, but the audience wants more of you, so let's keep it androgynous.
Olivia
You can manage, right? You are the main attraction of A Midsummer Night's Dream. We may still make some adjustments to Puck's lines, so be ready.
Kiki
Huh? We're premiering this new play in ten days, right?
Olivia
We'll perform the new Hamlet for a while, and after that, we'll alternate between A Midsummer Night's Dream and Hamlet.
Kiki&Thomas
Whaaaa?!
Kiki
Isn't that a bit much?
Thomas
We'll all have to perform both, right? My head's gonna burst!
Olivia
I'm very sorry about the suddenness of all this. To be honest, I know you all should be focusing on A Midsummer Night's Dream right now.
Olivia
I think that sticking to a single role and getting comfortable in it brings the best out in you as actors.
Olivia
But we can't afford the luxury of time anymore.
Kiki
Oh, is this...
Thomas
The bad news?
Olivia
...

Olivia turns to me, her eyes pleading.

I give her a small nod.

She nods back.
Olivia
Starting today, this troupe is on its own. Spencer ended his patronage yesterday.
Kiki
WHAT?!
Thomas
But didn't yesterday go well?!
Kiki
Did the patron dislike something about our performance?

Olivia shakes her head.
Kiki
Then why?
Thomas
Actually, are we even allowed to use the theater now?

Olivia looks down, her lips quivering, but says nothing.

Everyone's looking anxiously at her, but the silence only makes the situation more tense.
Will
We withdrew from his patronage. At my request.

Everyone looks at me.
Kiki
You turned down his support?
Will
Yes.
Kiki
But why?

I search for the right words.

If we become independent before striking success, we'll receive a larger share of our earnings later.

After seeing yesterday's enthusiasm from the crowd, I became certain we could be selected for a court performance.

I want to write new plays without worrying about the patron's stifling conditions.

None of these things would be a lie.

And yet, it wouldn't be the truth either.

I see the worry and unease in the eyes of the other troupe members.

It wouldn't be fair to lie to them.

...

My father's words come back to me.

Yes, if I start telling white lies, it won't be long before things collapse under the weight of truth.

I can't afford to be a lesser man.

This all started because of me and my impulses.

And I need to see it through.

I have no choice but to do so.
Will
Because I had no choice.
Will
I had no other choice if I wanted to take Olivia away from that man.

Olivia's eyes bulge out and her jaw drops.
Olivia
Of all the ways you could have worded that...
Kiki
Ah...
Thomas
You mean, take the leader from Spencer?
Kiki
But wasn't she his fiancee?
Will
Yes. I couldn't let Olivia remain under Spencer's thumb for the sake of keeping this troupe afloat.
Kiki
Huh? Is that true?
Olivia
Well...
Kiki
Wait, so that means...
Thomas
You stole both the troupe and his fiancee?
Will
No, I went to his manor yesterday and informed him of the change.
Kiki
How lily livered!
Thomas
Ain't much of a damn theft, then!
Will
You know how messed up in the head that man is. We have to do things properly.
Kiki&Thomas
A-Agreed.
Will
I am aware of the strain my decision puts on all of you. I'd like to apologize, first of all.

I bow my head.

The shock and confusion is apparent in everyone's countenance.
Will
After you left the pub yesterday, I heard that you were all receiving a monthly payment from Olivia.
Will
Taking those expenses into account, this is the only way to keep using the Globe without Spencer's help until we're selected for the court performance.
Kiki
So a new play in ten days.
Olivia
And a second one after that.
Thomas
Excuse moi?!
Kiki
What? You have another script?! Can you really write all that, Will?!
Will
...

Everyone turns back to me, clearly astonished.
Olivia
I think he's already written it. Isn't that right, Will?

Olivia quirks an impish smile and glances at me.
Olivia
It looks like we'll have a love story on our hands.

I snap my head back to her.

She's smirking mischievously.
Will
It can't be. How?! When?!
Olivia
You dropped it on the floor of your room. How could I not see it?
Will
No! That was a reject!
Olivia
Is that so? I didn't think it was that bad.
Kiki
Huh? What was it about?
Olivia
It looked like the story of how a young bartender falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman.
Kiki
Whoaaa...
Thomas
Isn't that a bit too obvious? Rein yourself in a little, lover boy.
Will
That's what I'm trying to do! Wait, no! I'm telling you it's a reject!
Kiki
Huh? Really?
Thomas
Bah, who cares? It sounds easy to follow.
Olivia
Hamlet has a lot of complex characterization, so I think a simple love story would be good.
Olivia
Go with that story.
Will
...
Olivia
Understood?
Will
I guess I can give it a shot.

Olivia nods and turns to the troupe.
Olivia
Everyone, our situation has changed considerably. I understand that this will be hard to accept for some of you.
Olivia
But while it was Will's decision, I approved his judgment.
Olivia
He helped me, and I don't regret it. That's the truth.
Olivia
I am terribly sorry to tell you all after the fact like this.
Kiki
...
Thomas
...
Olivia
I'd like all of you to help us make this happen. I understand if you don't want to subject yourselves to these conditions, though. I leave the decision to you.
Kiki
Decision, you say?
Thomas
Not like we have much else going on if we give up the ghost here.
Kiki
Yeah, right!
Will
The fact that we lost our patron will become common knowledge soon enough.
Will
You'll all be treated as vagrants. Are you okay with that?
Kiki
How is that any different from being our leader's slaves?
Will
...
Kiki
I mean, if it ever gets out that the leader is a woman who's acting on stage, we'll all be thrown behind bars all the same.
Thomas
If there ever was something to be afraid of, it isn't what others say about us.

Thomas says, tracing a straight line across his neck with his thumb.
Olivia
Yes, you're right.
Kiki
Yeah, but never mind that.

Kiki and Thomas exchange glances and giggle.
Kiki
You stole Spencer's fiancee! That's the best news ever!
Thomas
You put our whole career to shame, lad!
Kiki
I'm having the best time of my life, so I don't care if people want to call us vagrants.
Thomas
It would actually make for a good excuse to pick up thievery again.
Olivia
Don't be stupid! If anyone gets careless, it'll spell the end for the troupe. As long as we're here, you don't give up your pride as an actor.
Kiki
Hahah!
Thomas
Now that's more like it. Stay strong, leader.
Kiki
It's all fine. Let's do our best!
Kiki
Being chosen for the court performance without a patron would be a first in history!
Thomas
Vagrants entering the Royal Palace? Now, that would be damn well impressive!
Will
...
Olivia
...

My eyes meet Olivia's.

The tension we had been feeling all morning comes loose, and we laugh together.
Will
Guess they're all a bunch of rejects. You did well bringing all these people together, eh?
Olivia
Don't talk as though you're not included. You're part of this too.
Will
And you too.
Olivia
I'm well aware.

Olivia blows out a breath and ties up her long hair into a ponytail.
Olivia
Get ready to rehearse! First, we're gonna improve on yesterday's performance! Then we're gonna start practicing the new play! Get your scripts!
Olivia
We have no time to lose! I don't want to see any tomfoolery here, understood?!
Kiki&Thomas
Aye, ma'am!

For our second performance, the theater is clearly more packed than yesterday.

Just as we expected, everyone flooded the theater after hearing about Kiki.

The more attention Kiki commands, the easier it'll be to hide Olivia's gender.

If everyone's too focused on Kiki, we can hide the real woman of the group.

And after that, the story is what will draw the attention of the audience.

By putting it all out there, we can camouflage our biggest secret. It's our best and only shot.

We increased the amount of food and drink in the theater so it doesn't sell out immediately like it did yesterday.

Olivia bought the ale from our pub.

It compensates for the fewer hours the pub stays open because of our new tight schedule.

We have a full house once again.

But as things stand now, this is the bare minimum we need to keep afloat.

How long can we keep this going?

Everything depends on the answer to that question.
Olivia
I wonder how many of the people that came yesterday are here today?
Olivia
Do you remember any of them, Will?
Will
It's not like I go around memorizing every single face I see.
Kiki
Mmh, about thirty percent of them are repeaters, I'd say.
Will
Really? How do you know?
Kiki
Everyone started chanting when I came on in the second act yesterday, remember?
Kiki
They were all staring directly at me and shouting 'We don't care if he's a guy!'
Olivia
I figured they would.
Will
You did? Are you sure this is okay?
Kiki
And I think about thirty per cent of the audience today are chanting in time like yesterday. The rest are a little off tempo, so I suppose they must be new.
Olivia
I see.
Will
Let's assume the rate of regulars we get will be around thirty percent, then.
Olivia
Did everyone manage to fit into the theater today?
Thomas
No, we had to turn away a fair amount of people.
Olivia
What a waste.
Will
There's a lot of space between the seats on the second and third floors, right? Can't we put more seats in there? The third floor looks especially empty even when it's full.
Olivia
That's the area for nobles only. The price between first floor admission and third floor is completely different.
Will
Yeah, but it's still too much space. If we earn ourselves a good reputation, those pompous nobles will come even if they have to sit a little closer to each other.
Olivia
Yes, I suppose you have a point. They tend to be afraid of not being up to date with the latest trends.
Will
Okay, then let's put the same amount of seats we have on the second floor and try to encourage more nobles to come.
Will
And how about we also increase the amount of seats on the second floor and offer discounts to the people coming again so they can enter for a little cheaper?
Will
If we can expect thirty percent to come back, I think it wouldn't hurt to give them incentive and a new angle to watch the play from. That'll keep them hooked.
Will
That way people have a reason to come again, and even discounted, the price to enter the second floor will be better for us than cramming them all into the first floor.
Olivia
That might be a good idea, actually. Let's hand out fliers to the audience members on the first floor starting tomorrow.
Olivia
We can write down the date on them, and they can use them to enter the second floor at a discount price from that day onwards. Can we make it happen by tomorrow?
Kiki
Let's get our drinking buddies to help!
Thomas
Yeah, it's only fair since they have to put up with us constantly complaining about rehearsals.
Kiki
You didn't need to mention that.
Olivia
Okay, I'll leave the design up to you. Why not draw Kiki's face on them?
Kiki
Nice idea!
Thomas
So, like this?

Thomas draws a little sketch of Kiki on his script.
Olivia
That's really good!
Kiki
You captured my cuteness very well!
Will
Way to toot your own horn.
Will
It is really good, though. You're quite skilled at drawing, Thomas.
Thomas
I used to sell paintings a lifetime ago. I could even pass as a famous painter if the noble I was talking to was dumb enough.
Kiki
Ahahahah! Now that brings back memories!
Olivia
It's incredible. Why, I want to make a collection out of these. Can you draw a different pose each day?
Thomas
Like so?
Olivia
Incredible!
Kiki
Oh, I look so adorable!
Will
Haven't we gone through this before?
Will
Anyway, it's pretty good!
Thomas
I used to sell paintings a lifetime ago.
Olivia
And you even passed for a famous painter in front of dumb nobles, we know. I'll shut your mouth permanently if you keep repeating the same story over and over.
Thomas
...
Will
The praise was short-lived, huh?
Thomas
I'll get these ready in a flash as soon as I can gather up all my painting swindler buddies from back in the day. These doodles are easy enough.
Kiki
They're so fast at drawing that you can barely see their quills!
Thomas
It's good motivation when it feels like you're drawing pennies into your pouch, hahah!
Olivia
I will pay you all from a portion of the ticket sales. Do make them see the advantages of earning a wage through normal means rather than putting their necks on the line selling forgeries.
Olivia
That way we'll get the second floor packed, and they'll see more money.
Thomas
I'm glad our mighty leader understands how the mind of a swindler works.
Olivia
Don't underestimate me. You are not the only ones with experience in the field.

Thomas and Kiki exchange glances.

I can't help but smile at the scene.
Olivia
You're writing the new play, right, Will?
Olivia
Let me help you. You didn't make much progress yesterday, did you?
Will
You were watching me?
Olivia
I was, all the way until morning.
Kiki
You're writing together?
Thomas
Your very own love story?
Kiki&Thomas
How spicy!
Olivia
Why yes, I do wish it would be, but I've never met a denser man in my life. Talk about a late bloomer.
Olivia
Can you believe he didn't even try to lay a hand on me over the whole night? I do feel like I understand how Hermia must have felt.
Will
...
Olivia
Let's go, Will. We have only ten days until it's time for the new play.
Will
Y-Yeah.
Kiki
It's gonna happen, huh?
Thomas
They're getting no sleep.
Kiki
Actually, I don't think it can NOT happen, from the looks of it.
Thomas
Yeah, that's the kind of woman that just gets grumpier until she gets her way.
Kiki
You don't seem like you'd be good at ad libbing, so I hope you've got some sappy lines ready!
Thomas
I bet you can talk the talk, but can you grope that arse?
Will
I-I've had enough of you two!
Will
Shut it already! I-I... Just shut up!
Will
You pair of dolts!
Kiki
Truly, what a waste of good looks.
Thomas
There's a point where the naivete becomes a turn off, lad!
Kiki
Man up and get HER show on the road!
Thomas
Not even I'm a virgin, lad! You gotta get that taken care of!
Will
Ah, get off my back!
Will
...

You gotta be jesting.

Even Thomas has more experience than me?

After getting back home, we open the pub for a short while.

We told the regulars that we'd be reducing our business hours, so they all come in droves when we're finally open.

After the short rush hour, we close the pub and go upstairs to write in my room.
Olivia
What exactly are you stuck on?
Will
Up until now, I based all my stories off things people told me.
Will
But this is all me.
Will
Obviously, I'm the young bartender, and the noblewoman is you.
Olivia
Oh, I didn't notice.
Will
How funny. It's a little too close to home, so it's kind of hard to write about it.
Olivia
I see, but I don't think you should do away with that personal quality. The only thing to touch the audience's hearts are the lines that come directly from your own.
Olivia
You realized that while writing Hamlet, didn't you?
Will
Yeah.
Olivia
If you get all shy because you feel the setting of the story overlaps too much with your real life, it'll only become noise for the audience.
Olivia
So how about you change the setting to something you can look at a little more objectively?
Will
For example?
Olivia
What if there was an obstacle to their love?
Olivia
There are many things in the world of nobles other than social status that could do that.
Olivia
Oftentimes, a woman's future husband is decided by her parents, or sometimes two noble houses are on bad terms.
Will
Houses on bad terms?
Olivia
Yes, there are plenty of families with feuds between them.
Will
I think I've heard of such a thing before...

Feuds between families.

I follow the trail of my memory.
Will
...in Italy.
Olivia
Italy again? Another story from Rob?
Will
No, I read about it in a book. The title was, if I remember well...
Will
'The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet.'
Olivia
Romeus and Juliet?
Will
Yes. The man was selling translations of Italian novels, and he told me that one story.
Will
The story was...

It was set in a certain region in Italy.

A story about two families with an age-old vendetta.

The son of one family and the daughter of the other fall deeply in love and marry behind their parents' backs.
Will
But in the end, they both die.
Olivia
That's quite a simple tragic story, isn't it?
Olivia
But before they reach that tragic end, it is certainly a story about the love of two young dreamers.
Olivia
I think it's good. How about you?
Will
Yeah, we only have ten days. We use this story as a base to build my own words upon.

I raise my head.

Olivia is looking down at me.
Will
I'll write this story.

She quirks a pleasant smile.
Olivia
Good boy.
Will
Can you read out this line for me?
Olivia
Sure, which one?

Romeus or Juliet?

After thinking for a moment, I look up at her.
Will
Juliet's lines, thank you.

Olivia nods and takes the manuscript from me.
Olivia
So this is the scene where their love begins. I'm on the balcony right now, yes?
Will
And I'm below, looking up at you.

Juliet is talking to herself, unaware of Romeus' presence.

They have already begun to feel love for each other.
Olivia
O Romeus, Romeus! Wherefore art thou, Romeus?
Olivia
What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet! So Romeus would, were he not Romeus call'd.
Olivia
...
Olivia
Wait a moment, this is hard to say.
Olivia
O Romeus, Romeus! Wherefore art thou, Romeus?

Olivia stops and sounds out the words.
Olivia
The name is too long. We need something shorter if I'm to repeat it this much. Change it.
Will
Really?
Olivia
Wouldn't 'Will' work just fine? O Will, Will! Wherefore art thou, Will?
Will
Are you jesting?
Olivia
Of course.

Olivia frowns and furrows her eyebrows in annoyance.
Olivia
Hurry up.
Will
How about, uh, Romeo?
Olivia
Romeo... Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Olivia
Yes, that's good. Let's go from the top again.
Olivia
O Romeo, deny thy father and refuse thy name. If thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Will
I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized. Henceforth I will never be Romeo. By yonder blessed moon I swear.
Olivia
O, swear not by the moon.
Will
...

Olivia answers with a line that isn't in the script.
Olivia
Not by the moon, the inconstant moon. That monthly changes in her circled orb, lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Will
Olivia, that—
Will
...Juliet.
Olivia
Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night. It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.

The moonlight illuminates the room.

Olivia's not reading from the script anymore.

She turns her eyes to me, a mixture of anxiousness and longing swirling in them.
Olivia
At our feet lie years of bloodshed and enmity. Thy love, like a flash in the darkest of nights...
Olivia
It is too like the lightning, which doth cease to be.

Pure passion laces her gaze.

Her rose eyes gleam with a mysterious, beautiful glow, and I find myself unable to tear myself from them.
Will
...
Olivia
Do not swear at all, or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self.
Olivia
Swear by thyself, which is the god of my idolatry, and I'll believe thee.
Olivia
Swear not by the moon, but by thyself.
Olivia
Swear to me.

Her eyes seem to glimmer.

They shine with a pure brilliance, like a bright fire seen through a veil of water.
Will
I swear.
Will
By my heart's dear love, I swear. For it is my soul that calls upon thy name, and without it would certainly wilt.

The script slips out of my hands.

The words spring forth from the depths of my soul.
Will
To live without thy love would be the same as death.
Will
Certainly, I would rather sack this hateful anatomy of mine, were my world be one without your love.
Will
Therefore...
Will
By my life, I swear eternal love to thee.

Juliet...

No, Olivia looks into my eyes and smiles.

The soft moonlight shines through the window, playing across her hair and lips.
Olivia
Good night, good night, my Romeo. Parting is such a sweet sorrow, that I shall say good-night till it be morrow.
Will
...

The silence slowly melts away her sweet smile.
Olivia
So, what now?
Will
Oh, uh, right.

I look down at the script by my feet.
Will
Their first...

Olivia nods slowly.
Will
...kiss.

A meaningful smile comes back to her face.
Olivia
Don't cut corners. Keep going.

Step by step, Olivia approaches me.

She stops in front of me and looks up at me, her eyes flickering with that same gentle fire.
Will
...

Wordlessly, I draw her into my embrace.

Her hips are slender, and her whole body feels supple and soft to the touch.

Her eyes are right in front of me.

They're moist with tears and full of earnest desire.
Olivia
Is it Romeo about to kiss me?
Olivia
Or is it you, Will?

A sweet sigh escapes her lips and flutters across mine.
Will
Are you Juliet? Or—
Olivia
I'm Olivia.
Will
Then...
Olivia
...
Will
I'm Will.
Olivia
...
Will
...

She gently cups my cheeks in her hands, and we kiss.

The warmth and the texture of her lips on mine stuns me for a second.

I pull her even closer to me.

Olivia leans into me, accepting the embrace.

Our bodies come together in the most intimate of ways.

Her scent fills my lungs.

My senses are overloaded by her sensations. All I can feel is love.

Her faint sighs are loud in my ears.

We share a deep, passionate kiss for what feels like a lifetime.

When I try to pull back a little, Olivia slides her hand to the back of my head and pulls me in.
Olivia
Don't stop.

The tone that leaves her lips is something I've never heard before.

From the small space between her lips, her saliva mingles with my own.

Her taste spreads all across my tongue.

Slowly, we part the kiss.

Then, Olivia gently wraps her arms around my neck, her long sleeves riding up her arms.
Olivia
Will...

Her eyes are alight with desire.

And her fiery gaze is set upon me, licking at my very soul.
Will
Olivia...
Olivia
It's not over yet, right?

I answer with a nod.
Will
I don't know how good I may be at this, though.
Olivia
So long as it's with you, I'm happy.
Olivia
No matter how clumsy or inexperienced you are.

Olivia snuggles up to me and whispers into my ear.
Olivia
Make love to me. Just let it happen.
Olivia
I'll allow you to be poor at it, just for tonight.

After that, she pulls back a little.

She looks up at me again, a sweet smile crossing her face.

Under the moonlight, she undresses, stripping her clothes off one piece at a time.

Strangely enough, I feel no tension.

I take her in my arms and gently lay her down on the bed.

Until dawn, Olivia and I explore and love each other like never before.
