Kanna
Ugh...

The sleeping space inside Hachimaru isn't that big.

I can't even stretch my legs.

I wake up feeling a bit sore.
Azuki
*Snore*

I go out to the garage and find Azuki snoring away peacefully.

Her black top and jeans are haphazardly thrown on the back of a chair.
Kanna
...

......

Is she gonna sleep like this every day from now on?

She shouldn't be showing so much to anyone except her boyfriend or whatever.

How can she leave herself so exposed?
Azuki
Mmh...

She turns over and sideways in my direction.

The way her chest is sandwiched between her arms only emphasizes her cleavage.
Kanna
...

I clear my throat and head for the washbasin.

Seeing myself with short hair in the mirror surprises me for a second.

I wash my face and do some gargles.

It doesn't look like Azuki's waking up right now.

I take a look at my wristwatch.

Dad should have gone to work by now.

Even though I've only stayed in the garage for 2 nights, it feels like it's been way longer

It was Saturday when Sumomo showed up and I had a falling out with dad.

Considering I'm going to the academy starting today, I won't have time to relax.

I change clothes, get some more changes from my room, and then scavenge some food out of the kitchen.

The garage has a small fridge, and there's camping equipment, so we can light some fires.

I get cereal, milk, toast, and eggs.

I also grab instant coffee, dry spaghetti, and some bags of rice.

Plus some instant curry, pasta, and cup noodles as well.

All the easy to make stuff goes straight into a plastic bag.

I notice a single set of dirty dishes in the sink.

Imagining my dad eating here alone makes my heart ache.
Kanna
...

I wash them and put them to dry.

I hope he notices and understands that I'm not rebelling against him just because.

The idea of leaving him a note saying I'm going to class crosses my mind, but it feels a little too cowardly on my part.

How long do my classes take anyway?

It's been so long that I can't remember.

I should be able to get back home before he does, at least.

If I'm missing anything else, I can come pick it up.
Azuki
Ah, Candy. Where did you go?
Kanna
Um...
Azuki
Mm?
Kanna
This is kind of my garage, so try to wear clothes.
Azuki
Ah, my bad. It's just so hot.
Kanna
That's no excuse...
Azuki
Don't be shy! This is just some eye candy for my sweet boy!
Kanna
It's annoying...

I put down the plastic bag on the wooden stump table in front of the sofa.
Azuki
Whazzat?
Kanna
Food and my clothes.
Azuki
Oh, for real? What a nice host.
Kanna
Don't eat it all.
Azuki
Don't you worry, my boy. I'm used to living with people, you know?
Kanna
And that's why you parade around in your underwear?
Azuki
Oh? Where's the bananas?
Kanna
There's none.
Azuki
Why's that? Azuki's breakfast must include at least 50% bananas.
Kanna
That's news to me... Stop complaining and eat.
Azuki
Hey, how old are you again?
Kanna
Uhh, sixteen.

When she hears the answer, she stops on her tracks.
Azuki
Whoa, you're a baby. You don't remember anything before the wave eating started, right?
Kanna
I don't, yeah.
Azuki
I see... That so...
Kanna
Huh?
Azuki
Well, it's whatever. What else did you get? Eggs? We can make fires here?
Kanna
There's a stove and a kettle for camping that we can use.
Kanna
You can open the shutter and use them in front of the garage during daytime on weekdays, but put it all back in before evening.
Azuki
Gotcha.
Kanna
I'm going to class now.
Azuki
Go with the wind, young master.
Kanna
I'm gonna get angry if you keep making fun of me!
Azuki
You're angry already!
Kanna
Whatever!
Azuki
Hurry up.
Kanna
I'll notice if you steal something again, so don't even try.
Azuki
Copy that.
Kanna
And put on clothes.
Azuki
Copy that too.
Kanna
...

I heave a huge sigh.

And I'm supposed to be the kid when there's adults like that?

I'm already so fatigued that my steps feel heavy.

The academy, huh?

What a hassle.

There's basically no people I know there.

Just one week. Five days. And it's only during the day.
Kanna
Okay.

I leave home and walk to the academy for the first time in god knows how long.
Kanna
...

I look up at the sky to see it covered by a blanket of white birds.

And beyond that, I can see the streak of Halley's Comet.

It's the 11th today.

Just 2 weeks left until the 28th.

Am I really going in the right direction?

...

At least things changed.

I gotta go with the flow now.

It takes me about 15 minutes to make it to the academy in the end.

It's not that far away.

Apparently Nariyama Sky Academy used to be an international airport before.

But fifteen years ago there was a big accident that involved communications all over the world failing, and it was almost completely destroyed.

Terminal 1 was damaged even more, so it's a no entry zone now. Terminal 2 was in good enough shape that they rebuilt it into a science academy.

The air routes are closed now, and it seems like we can't use something called communication networks anymore.

To be honest, I just didn't grow up with any of that, so I can't imagine how life back then was like.

The only thing I know is that life used to be more convenient before.

I hear that people used to be able to carry mobile phones with them, have cars that drove themselves, and even right shop from home.

Mom and Dad's generation knew all about that.

It reminds me of the plane I photographed a few days ago.

If something that big really was able to fly through the sky before, I sure would like to have a ride at least once.

I would have also liked to photograph one of them while it flies.
Kanna
...

Maybe I can go and take pictures in the terminal when classes are over and I leave my stuff back home.

The academy comes into view.

The academy doubles as a research institution and a university. They also have high school and undergraduate courses, so the whole place is huge.

Both researchers and students go to the same place, so the entrance is always packed.

The academy's entrance is wide open.

There's remnants of the airport still.

There are two elevators leading up to the big hall on the fifth floor, and a neat little cafe on the left side.

I often see their ads for part-time jobs around the academy, so I'm sure the place must be manned by students.

The tables and chairs are arranged sparsely across the big space.

Students and people in white lab coats sit around the tables.

The academy is just as I remember it.

Nothing seems to have changed much in all the months I was absent.

I walk up to the elevator, taking in the familiar sights.

I can't even remember where my classroom is supposed to be, but I finally make it after following some directions on the building's map.

I can hear the voices of students behind the door.
Kanna
*Sigh*

I sigh and reach a hand out to the door.

Then, after taking a few deep breaths, I open it.

All noise in the classroom stops.

All eyes are on me.
Kanna
...

I try to not think about it and step in.

The first thing I realize is that I don't know where my seat is supposed to be.

My gaze wanders until I make eye contact with one of the boys seated in the front row.
Kanna
Um, I don't know where my seat is.

Upon hearing that, the boy simply points me to a seat by the back.
Kanna
Thanks.

I walk to the seat he pointed me to and sit down.

Thankfully, the seat is right by the back window.

And it's nowhere near the teacher's podium.

I look out the window instead of paying attention to the glances.

After a while, the others start talking again and the bustle returns to the classroom.

The academy's bell rings, and the door in the front of the classroom opens.

And from it, Sumomo walks in.

She turns my way as soon as she enters the classroom.

She looks over the classroom, then smiles and waves at me when she sees me sitting in what was probably an empty seat until today.

But then, I hear someone clear their throat in the back of the classroom.

At some point, a middle-aged teacher entered the classroom and sat in the folding chair near the rear door.

Is that her advisor?

After hearing him, she immediately puts her hand down.
Sumomo
Good morning, all. I'll take attendance. Aki...
Female Student
Present.
Sumomo
Amei.
Kanna
...Present.

Everyone turns to me again.

Sumomo steals a glance at me and smiles before looking back at her attendance book.

...

She's acting totally different behind that podium than her usual self.

Her voice sounds a lot more subdued, to start with.

And her expression is as stiff as stone.

She was the very image of life back in the garage.
Kanna
...

A little disappointed, I just stare at her standing there at the podium.
Kanna
*Sigh*

As expected, I was swarmed after such a long absence, and was finally let go after 4 p.m.

I eas asked about why I didn't come to class,  and told I need to have perfect attendance form now on if you wanna graduate in 3 years.

I was also advised to think about what I wanna do in the future seriously, and so on.

They also asked me to come  for complementary summer break lessons to make up for the lost time.

I just nodded and said yes to everything, but in the end I was still chewed out for 1 whole hour.

And the person doing all this was the same teacher that was looking over Sumomo this morning.

It seems like he's my homeroom teacher.

As for me..

I'd rather talk with Sumomo over him by a long shot.

No matter what came of it, Sumomo went through the trouble of coming to my house.

That other teacher that preferred to grill me over not coming today must have spent the weekend taking it easy instead.

On second thought, I suppose it's better that the credit for dragging a problem child back to school goes to Sumomo. I bet it'll help her career.

I didn't have any classes with her today.

I wonder if there'll be one lesson with her at least once this week.

At least I got through 1 of the 5 days.

Only 4 left.

I'll just shut up and endure it.

Just let it pass, Kanna.

Summer vacation starts in just four days. I can search for the place Mom was gonna shoot the comet from while we work on Hachimaru.

Hachimaru worked once before.

I'll just look over Azuki as she repairs it, and then look for Mom's location.

My summer plan is in motion now.

But Azuki might very well try to steal Hachimaru while I'm not looking.

If she lied about Hachimaru not being good again, she might be gone with it by the time I get home.

The anxiety that thought causes me turns my swift pace into a jog.
Kanna
*Huff* *Huff*
Azuki
Oh, Candy. You're all sweaty. Why so heated?
Kanna
*Huff* *Huff* ... *Sigh*

I find Azuki working under the hood.

I put my things on the sofa and stand next to her.
Kanna
What are you doing?
Azuki
Repairing it, of course.
Kanna
I can see that...

I notice black, box-shaped thingie by her feet.
Kanna
What's that?
Azuki
A starter.
Kanna
Huh.
Azuki
I think that's the problem. Neither the relay or the fuse had any issues.
Kanna
Really?
Azuki
Remember how the thing doesn't get cranking when you turn the ignition anymore?
Kanna
Y-Yeah?
Azuki
The thing that goes all vroom vroom when you turn the key and it tries to turn on.
Kanna
Oh, right.
Azuki
When you don't hear that, it means the electrical system is bust. The problem is either the fuse, the relay, or the starter.
Azuki
And sadly for us, it looks like the starter kicked the bucket this time.
Kanna
Is that bad?
Azuki
No choice but to order a new one. If it was a fuse I could get replacements, like those over there.

Azuki points to the back of the garage.
Kanna
I see...
Kanna
How long will it take?
Azuki
Hmm... About 2 weeks, I'd say?
Kanna
That's a long while.

I would get barely enough time.
Azuki
Without a starter, I can't even check up the fuel, air, or ignition systems in the first place.
Azuki
Though the scan tool isn't giving off any red flags.
Kanna
What's that?
Azuki
This little fella tells me where the failures are when I connect it onto the car.
Azuki
Since the standard hasn't changed, you can still use it on most stuff. It doesn't give as detailed a report as it does with current models, but it's good enough.
Kanna
So it'll work if we can get the new starter?
Azuki
Maybe. The scan tool isn't infallible.
Azuki
Though if it doesn't work at that point, even I would be a bit stumped.
Kanna
Oh...
Azuki
On that note, coffee.
Kanna
Uh, what kind of tool is that?
Azuki
Screw your head back between your shoulders, boy. I'm taking a break. Brew me some coffee.
Kanna
Oh, a cup of coffee, right.
Azuki
Sick. Thanks.
Kanna
...

I start rummaging through the plastic bag I brought this morning for the instant coffee when I realize something.
Kanna
Why do I have to make YOU coffee?! Do it yourself!
Azuki
Aw, come on! Don't be like that! I'm teaching you stuff, aren't I?
Kanna
...Well, yeah.
Azuki
The car won't be magically fine forever after I fix it this one time. Cars like this turn to scrap unless you know how to maintain them.
Kanna
...
Azuki
How does one coffee sound?
Kanna
...I got it.
Azuki
That's my candy.
Kanna
Don't push your luck.
Azuki
How was class?

She says, slurping up the instant coffee I brewed.
Kanna
What do you mean?
Azuki
Had been a while since you showed up, right? So, is that bitch really a teach?
Kanna
I didn't have class with her today.
Azuki
That so? What does the bitchy peach even teach? Agriculture or something?
Kanna
I don't think we have that course?
Kanna
But...
Kanna
That's a good question, actually.
Azuki
No matter what she teaches, I can barely imagine her doing it.
Kanna
Yeah.
Kanna
You said we have to order a new starter, right? Is there anything we can do while we wait for it to get here?
Azuki
Not much, I reckon.
Azuki
Remember how the car was making a funny sound while we pushed it? Something must have messed up one of the tires.
Azuki
Guess I'll take a look at that in the meantime. Then there's the bumper. I ordered a new one, but it's not like can't run without it.
Kanna
Mhm.
Azuki
You don't mind I took the liberty of ordering the parts, right?
Kanna
It's fine.
Azuki
Good.

I stare down at the mug in my hands.

The warm coffee glides across the polished bottom as I turn it around.

I see myself and my new haircut reflected in it, and I remember Sumomo's joyous smile when she finished styling my hair.

I wonder why Sumomo sounds so sad at class.

I can't help but wonder as I remember the joy she showed while cutting my hair.

After noticing Azuki bringing her own cup to her lips several times, I finally look back up.
Kanna
Is there anything I can help with?

Azuki eyes Hachimaru
Azuki
Not really, until the parts get here. It's just a waiting game now.
Kanna
Oh...
Azuki
Well, you can always look at me working if you want.
Kanna
All right.

After that, Azuki taught me about the tires. Time flies until we notice the sun setting.
Sumomo
Howdy!
Kanna
Huh?
Azuki
Bitchy! Wazzup!
Sumomo
Peach!
Sumomo
Well, it's not like I want you calling me peach either.
Kanna
What are you doing here?
Sumomo
Came to hang out?
Kanna
Why? I'm going to class. I'll be there tomorrow.
Sumomo
I know that already.

Sumomo pouts and looks at me with puppy eyes.
Sumomo
Just let me hang around with you guys! What's the harm in that?
Kanna
It's not like we're friends or anything.
Sumomo
I brought snacks!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
AND booze!
Kanna
I can't drink.
Azuki
Now you're talking, Bitchy! Let her in, Candy.
Sumomo
It's Peach! Actually, can you stop it with that nickname?
Kanna
*Sigh*
Azuki
Blegh! Another sweet one! The heck is this?! You brought a bunch of sweet crap!

Azuki shouts after downing her third colorful can of alcohol that Sumomo brought.
Sumomo
It's sooo yummy! It's like drinking juice.
Azuki
This is why you're the Bitchy Peach!
Sumomo
Ahahah! Try making sense!
Azuki
Damn sweet bitch.
Sumomo
Hahahah! So lame!
Azuki
I need you to stop calling people lame like that!
Sumomo
Ahahah!

I noticed Azuki's face getting red right after the first drink.

Sumomo's drinking at the same pace, but she's the same as usual.
Sumomo
Heh... You can call me the Scrap Hunter, Azuki.
Sumomo
Pfft! Ahahahah! Man, that was sooooo lame!
Sumomo
Who's gonna call you that with a straight face?!
Azuki
Sh-Shut your piehole before I clip it shut! You bitch! Four-eyes! Bowl head!
Sumomo
No, I'm not!
Azuki
You literally are!
Sumomo
This is not how I really look, dummy!
Azuki
The fuck are you talking about? Is the shitty sweet drink getting to your head already? I guess bitches can't hold their drinks!
Sumomo
This bitch can drink you under the table, you know?
Azuki
Nah, you're dead drunk already. I know these things.
Sumomo
You fell for it! Pretending I'm drunk is my talent!
Azuki
Obscene!
Sumomo
It's not! It's just, kind of like going with the flow!
Sumomo
Well, it's not it can't get just a little naughty.
Azuki
You slut!
Sumomo
But I only do it with guys I vibe with, not with just anyone! Besides, I used to make tons of money back when that was my gig.
Azuki
Huh? You mean like selling yourself?
Sumomo
That's the only thing I didn't do. I did use to work in night districts, though.
Azuki
Oh, like a hostess?
Sumomo
Yeah, at a cabaret! About when I was 20 years old.
Azuki
You?!
Sumomo
You bet! I used to get guys to spend over 1,5 million yen on a single night!
Azuki
Take a hike! You're just drunk and talking outta your ass! I know these things!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're the only drunk one here.
Azuki
I'm not! This is kiddies juice!
Sumomo
Man, I didn't expect you to be such a damn softie! Like, I'm falling in love! I wanna go and hug the crap out of you!
Azuki
Who do you think you're calling softie? ! I'm not a damn Q-car!
Sumomo
Q-car? What's that? You know, Kanna?
Kanna
Not at all.
Azuki
Like the old car toys! You know, the ones that you wind up and let go! They go all vroom vroom! They're damn cute!
Sumomo
Ahahah! Talk about generation gap! Your age's showing!
Azuki
Don't you dare! My name's Azuki!

Suddenly, she shouts at me.
Kanna
Uh, what?
Azuki
You were thinking of calling me grandma, weren't you?!
Kanna
No, I swear...
Azuki
Candy, I always knew. You're a bit cheeky, but you're a good kid.
Azuki
I always knew.
Sumomo
Hey, Granny!
Azuki
You're fucking dead!
Kanna
Man, you two sure know how to make noise.
Sumomo
Ahahah!
Azuki
Zzz... I'm not drunk... *Snore*
Sumomo
She's sleep talking. What a cutie.

Sumomo picks up her bag and gets ready to go home, but stops to look at Azuki for a moment.
Kanna
Have some mercy next time. I'm the one that has to deal with her.
Sumomo
Ahah! Sorry about that.
Sumomo
Though really, thanks. For hanging around and eating together and all that.
Kanna
Huh? I didn't really do anything. It was pretty much Azuki talking.
Sumomo
But you're lending us the place.
Kanna
I guess 1 or 2 more people don't make much difference.
Sumomo
But it made me really happy!
Kanna
...Whatever.
Sumomo
See you tomorrow.
Kanna
...Sure.

Sumomo waves goodbye then leaves.

For some reason, I see her off outside and watch her go for a while.
Kanna
...
Kanna
*Sigh*

I collect the empty cans scattered on the stump table and put them in a plastic bag.

There's still some snacks left, but I just throw them into the bag as well.
Azuki
Haah... I can hold my booze better!
Kanna
Yeah, yeah.
Azuki
I'm not... drunk at all!
Kanna
You're not...
Azuki
I'm no softie...

She slurs the last part of that sentence and shambles up.
Kanna
...
Azuki
...

She sits up, and just stares at me.

It's kind of scary.

Her mouth's a little open.

And those thin lips are...

No! This isn't the time for that! I gotta—
Kanna
I'm gonna go to sleep.

But before I can turn away, she grabs my arm and pulls.
Kanna
Aaah!
Azuki
We're not done talking yet!
Kanna
Wh-What is it?
Azuki
I tried drinking canned shochu highball until I got drunk once.
Kanna
Wha?
Azuki
And I didn't get drunk no matter how much I drank!
Kanna
Uuuh?
Azuki
Right?!
Kanna
Azuki, I—
Azuki
Right? Right?

Azuki whispers, as she brings her face close to mine.

I can feel her hot breath on my nose.

And it stinks!

It reeks of alcohol.
Kanna
M-Move over!
Azuki
I won't!
Kanna
You stink!
Azuki
I don't!
Kanna
Azuki!
Azuki
How am I a softie?! You damn bitch!
Kanna
Sumomo left!
Azuki
Huh? Ah, Candy. It's you. What is it? Why so chummy all of a sudden?
Kanna
Y-You're the one on top of me!
Azuki
Guess a healthy boy gets urges, huh? Ain't that right?
Kanna
K-Knock it off!
Azuki
You just wanna feel good, don't you?

Azuki says, as she begins drawing circles on my chest with her fingertips, slowly tracing her way down.

Her finger sinuously runs through my stomach.

Until it reaches my pants.

And then my...
Kanna
S-Stop it! Ah! Azuki!
Azuki
Heheh. Look who's packing heat down here.
Azuki
You want me to give you a good ‘ol overhaul down here, huh?
Azuki
Heheh...
Kanna
Ngh!

I can't get her off me.

I can feel her warmth all over me.
Azuki
Do you taste like cherries? Maybe milk?
Kanna
S-Stop...
Azuki
Ugh...

Azuki's sly smile turns into a tight pout, and I don't like the sound she's making.
Azuki
Ngh...

She's doing that sound again.
Azuki
...
Kanna
Huh?
Azuki
Blaaaaaargh!
Kanna
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Kanna
What the FUCK?!
Azuki
Blegh!
Kanna
I stink! Dammit!
Azuki
I barfed.
Kanna
I know!
Azuki
Time to sleep.
Kanna
You what?!
Azuki
Yaaaawn! Snoooore! Snooooore!
Kanna
That's now how snoring works!
Kanna
Hell! Why does this happen to me! Aaaah!

Suddenly, I notice I'm half crying.

I take off the clothes covered in her vomit and wash them in the sink.
Kanna
Dammit... Fuck... I hate women. They're the worst...
Kanna
When Hachimaru's fixed, I'm gonna kick you out!
Kanna
Dammit all...
Azuki
Zzz... *Snore* Zzz...
