Yonagi
Oh? You're up early. What are you looking at?
Kaito
Just some data about the virtual space from Asuma lab.
Yonagi
Oh, you can do that here?
Kaito
Izumo's real body is over there, so we can receive and send data through her.
Kaito
In principle I could just close my eyes and access it, but this feels more natural.

I tap some buttons on the calculator on the desk and show it to her.

It's just a crude terminal consisting of a display hooked to a keyboard.

Pretty much the same as my old terminal in the low side.
Yonagi
Yeah, it is easier when you have something tangible to work with.
Kaito
Most participants of the virtual world seem to have their own favorite input methods.
Yonagi
You know all that?!
Kaito
Well, I know pretty much everything about this space. Though there are privacy concerns, so there are some limitations to what I can access.
Kaito
I can gauge a lot about this world from studying the brain waves and biometric data of everyone in the space, but... there's something odd.
Yonagi
Odd in a bad way?

She asks, her eyes inquisitive.
Kaito
People's chronic stress levels are gradually building up. Put simply, it could be that the participants are growing tired of this world.
Yonagi
Tired?
Kaito
Perhaps bored would be a better term. There are no obligations here, and no need to worry about food or shelter.
Kaito
Everything was fine right after the move, but maybe they want some kind of change.
Yonagi
Change, huh? I guess I do remember stuff from the outside world. I feel like I wanna work again sometimes.

I nod at her.
Kaito
Asuma Lab has started developing a social system to create moderate labor and rewards for it.
Kaito
For example, we'd need a program that artificially dirties the cities in order to have people clean them.
Kaito
And they'll need to develop object data for buildings if they want to make up a construction industry. It won't be easy, and it'll take time.
Kaito
And people will need a way to kill time in the meantime for sure.

Yonagi smiles fondly at me.
Yonagi
So it's your job to look for a way to keep the people in this world happy, then.
Kaito
Maybe. I do admit I enjoy myself.
Yonagi
I'm super impressed. I enjoy myself enough just hearing what you're up to every day.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
Oh, it's just what you said. Being around someone who can share their news with you, or being made aware of new developments in the world could be a good way to kill time. If we could make it work easily, I mean.
Yonagi
Oh?
Kaito
Thanks, that gives me a good lead. I'll try making something out of it.
Yonagi
Glad to be of help, sweetie!
Kaito
Yonagi.
Yonagi
Yes?
Kaito
I used the idea you gave me and put together an application.
Yonagi
Wha?! So fast?!
Kaito
I'll send it to your terminal, so give it a look.
Yonagi
Um...
Yonagi
You mean this?
Kaito
Yeah, I call it Insta. You can share photos and comments to people that follow you there.
Yonagi
You could have asked me to for help to draw the icon for it.
Kaito
It's just a prototype anyway. Besides, it doesn't look that bad, does it?
Yonagi
No comment...
Kaito
Try it out.
Yonagi
Sure.
Yonagi
Hmm... Well, it is kind of what I expected.
Yonagi
Oh, this is actually well put together.
Kaito
Once you boot it up, it automatically creates an account for you. If there are other users nearby, they'll be displayed there so you can follow each other.
Yonagi
Ah, I have a follower already.
Kaito
That's my profile picture.
Yonagi
Oh! This does seem like fun!
Kaito
Let's try uploading a photo to test it.
Yonagi
Yeah! Take it!

I open up the camera on her small terminal and take a picture of her.
Kaito
It'll be better if you write a comment to go with it.
Yonagi
Yeah! I'm Yonagi, nice to meet y'all... and send!
Kaito
Mm, it's working normally. I made sure all the base features work properly, so I suppose it's good for release.
Yonagi
I'll take a picture of you too! Lend me your terminal!
Kaito
Huh? Err, I'm fine.
Yonagi
Aw, come on! We're doing this together! Look over here!

Yonagi takes my terminal and snaps a quick picture.
Yonagi
You write something too. Introduce yourself!
Kaito
Uhh...

"I'm the developer of this application. If you have any feedback or requests, feel free to contact me."
Kaito
This should do?
Yonagi
Yeah, great! Oh, I can see your picture from my terminal now! What's this heart mark thingie?
Kaito
That's the like button. You can use it to communicate to the poster that you liked their post.
Yonagi
Gotcha! What about the one next to it?
Kaito
That's a share button. It reposts someone else's post to your own followers.
Yonagi
I see! So I like your post and share it!
Kaito
Hahah, we're the only users, so you're not sharing it with anyone.
Yonagi
But this seems like so much fun! I bet it's gonna be super popular!
Yonagi
Kaito! Kaito! Look at this! It's super cool!

I'm woken up by Yonagi's insistent calling.
Kaito
Ngh... What's up?
Yonagi
Remember your insta application thingie? It's all the rage now! Look!
Kaito
Uh...
Kaito
200... million followers?!
Yonagi
It's amazing, isn't it?! Everyone's using the app!

I feel a smile forming on my face.

This is more than I expected.
Kaito
Huh? You're following three people now? One is me, and who are the other two?
Yonagi
Ah, right. That's Izumo and Iruma. Izumo made an account for herself! Right?!
Izumo
Yes, though I only have 120 million followers.
Kaito
Hahah, all of this overnight?
Yonagi
I bet you got a lot more followers, Kaito! I mean, you're the developer! Let's take a look!
Kaito
Yeah, sure.

I reach for the terminal by my bedside and click on the app to check my profile.
Kaito
Oh?
Yonagi
What?

The number of followers displays the three.

I also have three notifications.

I rub at my eyes in disbelief.

Then I take another look.

Three followers, no more and no less.
Kaito
Err, the servers might be overloaded. Must be lag or something.

I swipe my hand down, forcing the page to update.

But the number stays the same.
Yonagi
H-Huh? That's weird...
Kaito
I can't believe the number is that low. It's gotta be a bug or something.
Yonagi
R-Right?!

Just in case, I check my notification inbox.

There are only two new follower notifications.

And one share notification.
Kaito
Iruma and Izumo are my only other followers. And Iruma shared my first post.
Yonagi
Oh, Iruma, thank you so much.
Kaito
Izumo, why didn't you share my post?
Izumo
Uh...
Kaito
Share it. You have have a lot of followers, so it'll help. Don't you think so, Yonagi?
Yonagi
Y-Yeah...

I then scroll through my timeline.

There's 180 million likes for Yonagi's good morning post.
Kaito
I'll try posting again.

Perhaps my first post is just bugged.

I'm the creator of the app, for pete's sake. And creator of this whole space we live in!

No way everyone would just ignore me.
Kaito
Good morning, world... Post...
Yonagi
...
Kaito
No likes yet... No, no need to panic... Refresh...
Yonagi
I-Izumo, why don't you like his post? I'll do it too...
Izumo
Understood.
Kaito
Refresh... Refresh... Refresh... Refresh... Ah! Three notifications!
Yonagi
Oooh!
Kaito
Izumo, Yonagi, Iruma.... It's just you three!

I raise my face from the terminal and turn my teary eyes towards them.
Kaito
I don't need my family's pity likes!
Yonagi
K-Kaito!
Yonagi
He's gone...
Izumo
Leave him. He'll get hungry by nightfall and come back.
Yonagi
What is he, a cat?

I break into a run out of the cabin.
Kaito
*Huff* *Huff* *Huff*

I run all the way to the white beach, wallowing in endless misery.

Until I trip on the sand and fall flat on my face.
Kaito
Damn it... Damn it all...

Why? How could this happen?

I made the application to help keep everyone happy.

I'm still happy that people like it, of course.

But...

I felt a little bit of expectation in my heart.

This whole migration project is called the Kaito Project.

Regardless of how that name came to be, I am that very same Kaito.

I hoped people would recognize me for the world-changing invention.

For always caring about everyone.

I thought that people would praise me...

In a little corner of my heart, I expected those things.

Hahah, never thought I'd have more followers than Yonagi.

"Don't worry about numbers, it doesn't mean a thing."

I hoped I would be the one consoling Yonagi with those words today.

But where she has millions, I only have three.

Three followers!

Isn't that just zero when rounded down?

Isn't it the same as being followed by no one?

Even Izumo has over 100 million followers.

Did everyone forget about the name of this project?

It's the Kaito project, dammit!

I'm Kaito, people!
Kaito
I'll make them remember... Today I'll remind them!

I shove one impotent fist into the sand.

Again and again, until my knuckles sting.

I grab a handful of sand and squeeze as it escapes between my fingers.
Kaito
I'll be popular too...

"Pic of me. My wife says I'm a bit of a slob, but what do you think? One like to show my wife wrong. FYI, my wife's the goddess of the world! "
Kaito
D-Damn it... Only three likes... Yonagi, Izumo, and Iruma... My family again?! Dammit!
Yonagi
Kaito...

"Hello, it's me! Creator of this app an inventor of the virtual space here. You might think I'm a just a software wiz, but I know my hardware too.

This is a floating terminal I designed, planned, and manufactured all on my own.

I'll post more in detail about it if I get a few likes on this post."
Yonagi
It looks a little too desperate, sweetie... Your posts are getting too long.
Kaito
Ah, crap! The character limit! I need to update the app so I can post longer stuff. I gotta let people know more about me.
Yonagi
Kaito, you've been worrying me as of late. Are you sleeping well?
Kaito
\\fl How can I sleep with only three followers?!
Yonagi
Kaito...

"This is one of the spaces I designed. I've dreamed of seeing this in reality ever since I was a kid."

"I believe one of the best things about the virtual space is the sense of wonder it inspires."

"#KaitoThoughts"

"#LookingForPals"

"#KaitoTopTenSpots"
Yonagi
That's a lot of thingies at the end.
Kaito
Yeah, they're called hashtags. They make it easier to find people who post about the same topics as you. I think that finding common interests is important to help connect people.
Yonagi
Then maybe you shouldn't put your name in the hashtag...
Izumo
Your posts always start with you talking about yourself, I've noticed.
Yonagi
Izumo! Let him be! Just let him do his thing, please...
Kaito
If this doesn't work, I'll have to use my last resort.

"When I was young, there was a moment in time where I tried to recover Yonagi's memories.

Back then I was truly desperate and lost.

But my sense of duty saw me through, and there's not a day goes by without me being thankful for having her back."
Kaito
Okay I have... t-two likes?! I'm not even getting the three likes from you guys?!
Yonagi
I-I'm sorry? It was too embarrassing to press like.
Kaito
What?!
Yonagi
F-Forgive me...
Kaito
H-Hahah, it's okay. You don't have to like every single thing I post...

I see Yonagi and Izumo's posts scroll by on my timeline.

"Morning, everyone!"

There's 100 million likes on Yonagi's post.

What is the nature of a like?

What does it mean to follow? To be a follower?

The answer still eludes me.
Kaito
No, I'm not done yet... I still have fight in me... I need to add more features!
Kaito
Someone in the world must have posted about me. I just haven't seen it yet...
Kaito
Just one post, even a passing mention... Someone must have shown some interest in me...
Kaito
I never thought I'd need to add this feature, but I clearly have no choice.
Kaito
A search function! It's complete!
Kaito
Okay, now I only need to look for the keywords.
Kaito
And those are...

"Kaito hot"
Kaito
Okay, this should work. If I see a hate post, I'll cry, but here goes...
Kaito
No, take a deep breath. You're not this stupid, man. No one has ever posted anything with those two words in it. There aren't gonna be any results, you know that.
Kaito
I know that. But I do need to check that the new feature works.
Kaito
If there's zero, then that's that. No harm in checking.
Kaito
Okay... Search!
Kaito
I-Iruma...

The first and only result is a post by Iruma.

A post from today, in fact.

From what I can gather, he posted on one of my old photos immediately after I posted it.
Kaito
W-Why?

Why aren't Iruma's posts showing in my timeline?

This is a huge bug, it must be.

I click on his profile and check.
Kaito
Two followers? Lower than me?
Kaito
He's following me...

And then, it finally dawns on me.
Kaito
It can't be...

...
Kaito
I never followed Iruma? He followed me on the first day, and I...

The screen goes blurry.

Sudden tears fall onto my desk.

Clutching the terminal, I let out pitiful sobs.
Kaito
Iruma... Iruma... This is why I love you!

What if I was in his position?

If I had followed Iruma but he never followed me back?

Would I have been able to comment on one of his pictures?

Would I have been able to praise him in such a friendly way despite my attention not being reciprocated?
Kaito
I... couldn't...

Not a chance in hell.

Looking back on my behavior these past few weeks, I realize.

I was too preoccupied with gaining followers.

Too greedy for likes on my posts.

I was too absorbed with posting about myself to realize that I didn't even follow Iruma back.

Who am I to speak about people connecting with each other?

I look up at the ceiling, calm washing over me.

The tears welling in my eyes run down the sides of my face.
Kaito
...This beautiful world never had any need for this.
Kaito
You can't develop real connections just staring at a screen and scrolling through all day.

I make a decision...

I delete the Insta application from the server.
Yonagi
Kaito? I haven't been able to connect to Insta since yesterday.
Kaito
Yeah... I deleted the app.
Yonagi
You what?! Why?! It was fun!

I smile at Yonagi and shake my head.
Yonagi
Eep! Wh-What's with the creepy smile?
Kaito
I realized that, while I was looking at the app, I wasn't growing as a person. Even though we're here in this beautiful world we made, all I was doing was staring at a screen.
Yonagi
O-Okay? I think it's okay to just relax and not think about that kind of stuff all the time, though.
Kaito
I finally understood. It's okay if it's a little inconvenient to meet up. It doesn't matter if you don't get to see people much, or if you have some time alone.
Kaito
Those are the moments that makes us appreciate others. It's what makes us compassionate.
Yonagi
Uh, are you sure about this?

I pace over to the door and open it.

The salty breeze caresses my cheeks.
Kaito
I'm heading out.
Kaito
I'm going to see Iruma.
Yonagi
H-Have a nice day out there.
Izumo
Take care.
Kaito
You two have a good day now.
Yonagi
Yeah...
Yonagi
There he goes.
Izumo
Out to touch grass.
Yonagi
...Insta wasn't that bad. I think he could have enjoyed it if he didn't take it so seriously.
Izumo
Shall we bring it back? I have all the code to make it work.
Yonagi
No, I think he's had enough of social media. It's okay.
