...

I realize I've been crying.

I get up and wipe my tears.

It may be just a dream, but the pain of saying farewell to a loved one is very real in my heart right now.

I turn to look at Yonagi.

I get up, walk to her bedside, and gently wipe away the tears pooling in the corners of her eyes.
Yonagi

Yonagi
Kaito?

Still half-asleep, she reaches out to me.
Kaito
I'm right here.

I hold her hand in mine, and we stay like that for a while.
