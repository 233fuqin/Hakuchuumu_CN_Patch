Kaito
Hah... Hah...

My eyes snap open and I turn to the sleeping Yonagi.

It happened again.

I saw another unfamiliar vision.

Is this Yonagi's power?
Yonagi
...Kaito.

Yonagi groggily opens her eyes.
Yonagi
What's wrong?
Kaito
Oh...

I struggle to regulate my breathing so that she doesn't notice how shaken up I am.
Kaito
It's nothing. I was just watching you sleep, that's all.
Yonagi
I see.
Kaito
Are you still sleepy?
Yonagi
Mhm...
Kaito
You can keep sleeping.

I put the palm of my hand against her forehead and gently let it glide left and right.
Kaito
The next dream we have together will be the last.
Kaito
I'll be with you soon.
Yonagi
...Okay.
Kaito
Good night.
Yonagi
...Good night.

Her breathing becomes calmer, and before I know it, she's asleep.
Izumo
This will be the last dream.
Izumo
Are you ready?
Kaito
...Yeah.

I turn to face Izumo.
Kaito
I know you probably won't tell me anything, but I might as well ask.
Izumo
What is it?
Kaito
I think I have a hunch... about who the mastermind behind this whole elaborate setup is.
Izumo
...
Kaito
Would you hear me out?
Izumo
As long as you don't expect an answer.

I feel the corner of my mouth twitch upwards.
Kaito
Going by what little I know, the only person who could put all this together is...
Kaito
Me. I don't believe it could be anyone else.

Izumo gives me a level stare.
Kaito
I may not have my memories...
Kaito
But I can feel that Yonagi is important to me.
Kaito
And if this plan will serve to help her, I'm sure I would cooperate.
Kaito
But there is no third-party intervention. This plan seems able to be carried out to its completion with only the four of us in this room.
Kaito
And I believe I may be familiar with the workings of the human brain and memory formation. I wouldn't be able to keep up with what you say otherwise.
Kaito
If that's the case, and I'm right, the only person behind all this has to be me.
Kaito
What do you think?
Izumo
Once you finish the last dream, everything will become clear.
Izumo
You will know, whether you want or not.
Izumo
That question is not one for me to answer at this point in time.
Kaito
...Okay.
Kaito
Let's finish that last dream.
