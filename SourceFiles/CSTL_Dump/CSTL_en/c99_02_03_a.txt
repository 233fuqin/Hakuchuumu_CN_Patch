The air outdoors feels a little chilly.

I walk ahead, looking up at the sky.

A wave of relief hits me.

This is the sky I know.

The round sky, surrounded by high walls.

The outside world is just as I... remember.

I look down and see the whole span of the cityscape spreading in front of my eyes.

The familiar sight of the outer walls lined with houses on their surface.

And above that, the sky is blue and the sun dazzling.

This is the world I know.

Without my memories, I can't really judge how much of my perception is correct.

But this is the Japan I know. I know in my heart that this is Shinjuku.

I wonder if anyone has found a way to really stand under that sky.

It doesn't look like much has changed from the mental image I seem to have, so the answer is probably no.

Taking a deep breath, I notice tiny dust particles mixed into the air.

The air indoors is a lot cleaner than outside.

That too...

...is the world I know.
Kaito
Huh?

When I get take the elevator and go back to the eating area, I find no one there.

The dishes Yonagi and I used have been put away as well.

Yonagi's probably sleeping already.

Izumo and Wooleep are also nowhere to be seen.

But I don't find anyone in the room either.

Yonagi's bed is empty.
Kaito
Mm?

I notice a set of clothes neatly folded on my bed.

They're exactly the same as the ones I'm wearing right now.
Kaito
...

I lift up my arm and take a whiff.

Thankfully, it doesn't smell.

But perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to take a shower before the next dream.

The bathroom should be...

I recall the time Izumo guided me around.
Kaito
...

I hear the sound of running water on the other side of the door.

So Yonagi's taking a shower. That makes sense.
Kaito
Should I come back later?
Izumo
No problem.
Kaito
Izumo? Were you watching me?
Izumo
Yes. This entire facility is under constant surveillance.
Kaito
Gotcha.

The sound of water stops.

I can hear someone moving around in the shower room.
Kaito
I'll come back later.

But just then, the door opens.

Hot steam rolls out into the corridor.
Izumo
Yonagi is done with her bath. Feel free to enter.
Izumo
Come in.
Kaito
...
Izumo
Are you coming in?

I cautiously step through the steamy entrance.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
...
Izumo
Go ahead, the bath is open. It's unisex.

Izumo's deadpan tone echoes through the hot room.

Yonagi is looking at me as though I'm just a part of the furniture.

My eyes are helplessly drawn towards the obvious.

Her wet white hair clings to the modest curves of her chest.

Her hair and skin share almost the same shade of white.
Izumo
Aren't you going to undress?
Kaito
I don't think I will, no.
Izumo
Why not?
Kaito
I'll come back later. You need time to dry her hair, right?

Yonagi's gaze stings me.

I can't read any emotions on her face, but the lack of expression itself feels recriminating.
Izumo
Your heart rate is increasing.
Kaito
...
Izumo
There is a sudden concentration of blood in your lower abdomen.
Kaito
Enough with the live broadcast.

Izumo nods in response.
Kaito
I'll take a bath next time I wake up. I'm going back to sleep.
Izumo
It appears to me that you are in a state of excitement. I believe it will not help you sleep.
Kaito
...That's why I'm not undressing.
Izumo
The swelling should not hinder your ability to undress.
Kaito
Yeah, no.
Izumo
Hm?
Kaito
...

If I had my memories, would have I behaved differently?

No, I get the feeling my reaction would be about the same.

I should just go back to bed, before she gets back.

If Yonagi's in the same room, I'm sure I won't be able to sleep well.

Heaving a deep sigh, I head back to the room on my own.
