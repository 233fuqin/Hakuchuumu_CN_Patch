I give my morning lectures as usual.

That includes the second-year class Rin attends.

It's a relief that I'm able to stay calm.
Arishima
The Pillow Book is one of the three greats of classical literature. It was written by Sei Shonagon, who served as a court lady to Empress Consort Teishi.
Arishima
The other two are Kamo Chomei's 'An Account of my Hut,' and Yoshida Kenko's 'Essays in Idleness.'

As I write on the blackboard, the students copy.

Bits of chalk powder fall to the floor as I write.

The chalk is a little shorter compared to when the class started.

Even chalk changes.

But I'm still stuck in my routine.

After class, most of the students leave their seats.

Some are still left copying what I wrote on the board.

It's better if I keep myself from looking that way during class...

I glance at Rin's seat.

She's looking out the window again.

I stare at that almost dreamlike profile of hers.

I try to follow her gaze.

There are students from another class who finished earlier scattered around the courtyard.

Rin looks down at them through the window.

I compare her to them.

Somehow, I feel like there's a huge gap between them.

It almost doesn't seem like she's sharing the same time and space as the other students. It's like she's outside of it all.

There's something about her...

My gaze wanders to her supple, round cheeks once again as I'm deep in thought.

Hatano Shuho's private life was covered by an opaque veil.

And inside of it, that's where Rin grew up.
Arishima
...

Rin looks at me.

Our gazes collide and connect.

I say collide, because I swear I could almost hear the sound of our eyes meeting.

It's that smile.

The way she narrows her eyes and quirks the corners of her mouth ever so slightly.

Her smile exerts some kind of magic that makes you forget to breathe.

Still smiling, she turns back to the window.
Schoolgirl
Professor.

I notice someone's calling to me and tear my gaze away from her.

A student sitting in the front row looks up at me.
Schoolgirl
I can't see the blackboard.
Arishima
Ah, sorry.

I stow the attendance record and my textbooks under my arm before leaving the classroom.

Will Rin come to the library after classes are done for the day, I wonder?

I decide to skip the cafeteria today.

I'm sure she'll be there eating alone.

When she's in my field of view, I feel something shift within me.

No...

I decide to just hang in the smoking area today.

I skip lunch and I don't even open my book.

Have I started to change somehow?

How many years has it been since I skipped lunch?

Just then, the second pre-class rings.

Watanabe shows up at the usual time and takes a cig from me.

I stay relatively silent, watching the smoke rise from the cigarette in my hand.
Watanabe
Arishima?
Arishima
Huh?
Watanabe
You listening to me?
Arishima
Uh...

Watanabe squints at me suspiciously.
Watanabe
I'm telling you that my whole generation's suddenly rushing to get married.
Arishima
Oh, really?
Watanabe
This is the third damn wedding I've had to go to in the last two months! You know the money you gotta spend for a proper gift? The food certainly wasn't worth it.
Arishima
Oh, I see. Yeah, that stings.
Watanabe
You can say that again! I gotta get married myself and get some of that investment back! Actually, a lot of the people who married in their twenties are divorcing around now.
Watanabe
You think they'd mind giving back the gifts? Not like they're gonna care for them now.
Arishima
I should think someone in the middle of a divorce has their mind elsewhere.
Watanabe
Yeah, but I'm spreading myself thin here, man! All these damn weddings take a toll on us bachelors.
Arishima
Yeah, I can see that.
Watanabe
How about a full repayment policy if a couple divorces within three years?
Arishima
...
Watanabe
Five years is half the money, ten years is twenty percent. And beyond that... I'll let it slide.
Arishima
I don't really know what to say to that.
Watanabe
I mean, money is important, man.
Arishima
...

I wonder where he's going with this.

Are we gonna start talking about the economy now?
Watanabe
So with this refund system I'm thinking of, I bet people would think twice before getting a divorce!
Watanabe
Even if it's not, like, law, we could start making it a custom! It'd even help combat the falling birthrate.

Really?
Watanabe
And if people get divorced, we get to use the money for another wedding!
Watanabe
It's a cycle of happiness, man. Everyone wins here! What do you think?
Arishima
I don't think it's gonna make people have kids just 'cause they're scared to get a divorce.
Watanabe
Well, you know how men and women are. Don't you, Mr. Hubby?
Watanabe
Even if people just stay together so they don't have to pay back the cash, maybe the time together helps their marriage catch a second wind!
Arishima
...

I can't even begin to imagine that happening.
Watanabe
How about you? How many years have you been married?
Arishima
Hmm, good question.

21 years.

We graduated from college and married when we were 24.

This year will be our 21st year of marriage.
Watanabe
What was your wedding like?
Arishima
That's another good question.
Watanabe
Aw, how cute. You getting shy on me?

I let out a dry chuckle.
Watanabe
Time's creeping up on me, though. When I reach my forties, I wanna be able to sit back and chill as a married man.
Arishima
I don't think getting married has much to do with that.
Watanabe
You bet your ass it does! That's how the Japanese machine works.
Arishima
You're pretty damn conservative for a kid.
Watanabe
Aw man, I don't wanna go.
Arishima
All the gifts got you hurting for money, right? Better go get that bread.
Watanabe
Damn, you're right! Yep, back to the cage with me.

This is a usual conversation for us.

It's fine.

There's nothing to be afraid of.

I just have to do what I always do.

After classes are over for the afternoon, I head to the library.

I'm not going there to see Rin.

This is just my daily routine.

I keep telling myself that.

Today, I choose a new book that collects Shuho's essays.

I pick it up hoping to find something that'll tell me more about the person rather than the writer.

He wrote about many things. From cooking to wine, whiskey to furniture, even music and cars.

It's nothing short of impressive how a man with his creative output had time to delve in so many hobbies.

The writing is pretty light, so I make it all the way to the afterword in just over an hour.

That's when someone sits down on the chair opposite mine.

I raise my face.

Rin is looking at the book in my hand.

Our eyes meet, and she smiles.
Rin
Are they good?
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
My dad's books.
Arishima
Uh, erm...
Rin
You were reading one of them yesterday too, right? Thank you.
Arishima
...

I glance at her hands.

She's holding another Shuho novel today.

On closer inspection, the spine of the book doesn't bear a library label.
Arishima
That book...

Rin nods.
Rin
It's mine. They only have paperback editions here.
Arishima
You prefer hardcovers?

She nods again.
Rin
I wanted to read one with less revisions.

Rin opens the book and shows me the colophon.
Rin
First edition.

Her tone is void of emotion.

I look from the page back up to her face and nod slowly.

Seeing this, she smiles softly.

After that, she flips through the pages and stops at the beginning of the book.
Arishima
So you, uh...

She looks up at me and waits.
Arishima
You like your dad's books?

She shakes her head slowly.
Rin
Not particularly, no.
Arishima
...
Rin
That's not quite it. I'm not saying I hate them, of course.

I ponder on her words for a while.
Rin
How about you?

I look at her.
Rin
You like my father's books?

I think for a moment before answering.
Arishima
I don't think I'd say I like them either.
Arishima
I suppose I was kind of an acquaintance of his, at one point.

Rin stares at me for a while.

And then, she nods again.
Rin
I had the feeling that was the case.
Arishima
How does it feel to read your dad's books?
Rin
How does it feel?

She mutters the words, as though feeling them out, then turns her eyes down at nothing in particular.

Then, she slowly speaks.
Rin
I don't know my father. Never did.
Arishima
...

I keep my eyes on her and wait for her to keep going.
Rin
I want to know him... And this is the only way for me to do so.

She murmurs haltingly.

It feels like she's just letting the words in her heart dribble out, rather than actually talking to me.
Rin
But...

She slowly closes her book.

Her slender fingers stroke the cover.
Rin
I can't sense even a shred of him from his books.
Arishima
Sense him?
Rin
But this is all I have left.
Arishima
Huh...

I think I understand what she's trying to say.

There are novels where you can feel the writer behind the words.

Some writers are pretty visible in their works, while others are almost imperceptible.

Hatano Shuho was well known for making many revisions to his novels.

And each revision apparently improved on the writing style.

Maybe his presence faded away with each revision?

The title of "book vintner" sounds a bit ironic, in that case.
Arishima
That's why you're reading first editions?

Rin looks up at me and nods slowly.
Arishima
You're his daughter; can't you get stuff like drafts or manuscripts with his notes on them?

Rin stares at me without answering.

The extended silence between us starts to feel a little awkward.

For the first time, her smile looks cold.
Rin
I think I'm too much of a coward.

She says flatly, before opening her book again and looking down at it.

I don't think there's much point in pushing the topic.

I feel as if there's a hint of intent behind her expression.

Unable to decide whether to move seats or not, I end up picking up my next book and reading beside her.

She keeps reading her book without getting up from her seat even once.

The sun sets and the library gradually empties out.

There are no exams at this time of the year.

But as exam season approaches, there'll be more students crowding the tables.

The chime that signals it's time to vacate the campus rings in the distance.

As an instructor, I'm not obligated to leave, but there's really no reason for me to stay longer, so I take this as my cue to leave as well.

"All students must finish club activities and leave the premises."

The little pre-recorded message plays out through the speakers.

I pick up three books and stand up.

Rin raises her face to look at me.

Staring at me, she puts a bookmark on the page, then closes the book.
Arishima
Find out anything about your dad?

She smiles and shakes her head.
Rin
I never do, no matter how many times I reread them.
Arishima
...

What kind of father was Hatano Shuho?

What kind of person was her mother?

Her life...

What kind of life has she had so far?

There are so many things I want to ask her.

But I don't feel it's appropriate for a teacher to ask a student such questions.
Rin
You like the library too, right?
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
You're always here until pretty late.
Arishima
Oh, yeah...

I wonder.

Do I like this place?

No, not really.

I'm only here because I have nowhere else to go.
Rin
Am I wrong?
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
You're thinking really hard about it.

She lets out a little giggle.
Arishima
No, uh, I was just thinking about whether I actually like it or not.
Rin
And?
Arishima
I don't hate the place.
Arishima
I guess that'd mean I... like it, I suppose.

Rin nods.
Rin
Process of elimination?
Arishima
Process of elimination.

I repeat her words back like a parrot.
Rin
So you have nowhere else to go, and this is only place you can come to.
Arishima
I guess that fits the bill better.
Rin
You're a complicated person, huh?

She laughs again.
Arishima
Me?
Rin
Yes.

Now that takes me by surprise.

And, judging by the way she's smiling at me, I imagine the confusion is clear on my face.
Rin
You never give me a straight answer.
Arishima
...
Rin
But I guess a vague answer leaves more possibilities open.
Arishima
No, I...
Arishima
I don't think so.

Rin looks at me attentively.
Arishima
When I do that, it's because the possibilities narrow so much I feel hopeless. Like there's no wiggle room.
Arishima
I can tell you that much.

She narrows her eyes a little and give me a small nod.
Rin
I know what you mean.

Rin waits for me by the library's entrance while I return the books I finished.
Rin
You were an acquaintance of my father's, right?

She says, walking a few steps behind me.

Turning back, I see her looking up at me.
Arishima
We attended the same university seminar.
Rin
Professor Yamada's.

I nod.
Rin
Then that means you write too, then?
Arishima
...I did, a long time ago. I couldn't keep writing like your dad.
Rin
You don't write anymore?
Arishima
No.
Rin
Oh, I see.

I turn back around and keep walking.

She's behind me, out of view.
Rin
I'd like to read your writing, though.

Her words almost stop me in my tracks.

Again, I turn and look back at her.

She's looking up at me again, her upturned eyes still inquisitive.

I'm taken aback by this girl.

While I'm looking over my shoulder, I stumble on something.
Arishima
Ah!

She watches me trip and laughs.

Righting myself,  I turn to her again.
Arishima
No, I don't write. I never did.
Arishima
I don't think I'll ever do it.
Rin
Oh, really?

I nod.

And so, we walk across the campus without saying much else.

She wants to read what I write?

Why did she say that? That's the only thing in my head.

Maybe she just said it out of courtesy.

Thinking about it rationally, that's the only answer that makes sense.

I keep thinking it over until we make it to the entrance to the main campus building.
Arishima
See you tomorrow.
Rin
...
Arishima
I'm going to stop by the staff room before I head home.

Silent, she nods.
Rin
Professor.
Arishima
Hm?

She clasps her bag with both hands in front of her and looks down at them.

Then, she slowly raises her face to look up into my eyes.
Rin
What kind of person did my father seem like to you?

That's a tough question.

The fragile look on her face brings home to me how young she really is.

She probably came to me today because she wanted to know about her dad.

But unsurprisingly enough, I don't have the answers she's looking for.
Arishima
From where I stood, he was a flawless genius.

I slowly shake my head.
Arishima
You said that you couldn't sense him in his works.

Rin nods.
Arishima
He probably gave off the same impression you get from his writing. I don't know any more than that.

She nods again.

Then, she bows her head a little.
Rin
Thank you.
Arishima
To be honest, I'd like to ask you the same thing. What kind of person did Hatano Shuho seem like to you?
Rin
Why?
Arishima
I wanna know.

She stares at me in silence for a moment.
Rin
That man was never a parent to me.
Rin
I know nothing about him.
Rin
He didn't leave me a place to belong.
Arishima
So you're in the library by process of elimination too?

She turns her eyes upwards to meet mine.
Rin
I suppose, yes.

Her smile seems a little desolate right now.
Rin
Being alone at home is too quiet, and the classroom is too noisy.
Rin
So by process of elimination, I suppose the library is my perfect spot.

My eyes widen in surprise.
Arishima
You live alone?
Rin
Yes.

Her answer is plain and short.
Rin
A huge house and money I won't spend in a lifetime. That's all my father left me.
Rin
But I'm sure that's not where I'm supposed to be. It's not my home.
Rin
Though I suppose I would have a bit of a hard time without the money.
Arishima
I see...

As I look down and mutter, Rin smiles at me again.
Rin
See you tomorrow.

I look up at her.

She bows and smiles before turning her back on me.

And then, she walks towards the main gate.

I watch her walk away for a moment.

I don't need to stop by the staff room.

But I feel a seismic shift inside of me when I talk to Rin.

I'm afraid of this feeling.

I can't picture myself escaping the inertia that has become my life.

Devoid of tension, simply repeating the same day over and over as I march on inevitably towards death.

I stare intently as she walks away.

I keep watching until she's out of view.
Watanabe
What are we looking at?

My head snaps back at the sudden call out.
Arishima
...
Watanabe
Weird to find you here this late.
Arishima
That so?
Watanabe
Yeah. I mean, you're not in charge of any clubs.
Arishima
...
Watanabe
Right.
Arishima
...
Watanabe
So, who's that kid?
Arishima
Watanabe.
Watanabe
Hm?
Arishima
Wanna go for a drink?

Watanabe looks like his eyes might pop out of their sockets.

We go to the nearest station, take the train, get off two stops later, and head for a popular chain bar.

I haven't been here since I was a student.

And before I got my current job, I was living the life of a starving wannabe writer, so I couldn't afford to go out.

There's a different kind of bustle going on here than at the academy.

The air is thick with the scent of oil and cigarette smoke.
Watanabe
You drink often?
Arishima
Not at all.
Arishima
I haven't in years. Not since my student days, at least.
Watanabe
Whoa, you're like a decrepit old unicorn.
Arishima
How about you?
Watanabe
I'm not exactly rolling in dosh as a teacher, so I can only come to cheap joints like this when I wanna drink.
Watanabe
Maybe once or twice a week.
Arishima
Whoa, that often?
Watanabe
Yeah.
Arishima
Who with?
Watanabe
Other teachers, sometimes, or friends from college. Or girls.
Arishima
Girls?
Watanabe
So I use one of those hookup apps. Otherwise it's hard to meet anyone. I mean, I'm single and girls aren't exactly knocking on my door.
Arishima
I had you pegged for the popular type.
Watanabe
I kinda was, I suppose. Back when I was younger.
Arishima
Doesn't seem like you have much trouble picking up girls now, though.
Watanabe
I'm loved by many, but never by the one. You totally look like the type to charm a woman hard, though.
Arishima
I'm married.
Watanabe
Doesn't matter, does it?

Watanabe taps on the menu touch panel.
Watanabe
Whatever's on tap okay with you?

I nod.
Watanabe
You're forty-five years old, right?

Another nod.
Arishima
How about you?
Watanabe
Thirty-six, chief.
Arishima
Ah, stop it.

Watanabe lets out a little cackle.

A waiter comes over to us carrying two mugs.
Watanabe
Cheers!
Arishima
Yeah.

We clink our mugs together.

Watanabe chugs down half his drink in one go.

I take a big sip and put it down.
Watanabe
Mind if I order for us?
Arishima
Just go easy on the fried stuff.
Watanabe
Copy that.

I take out a cig and light it up while Watanabe orders via the touch panel.

I exhale once before taking another drink.
Watanabe
Gimme!

Silently, I pass him a cigarette.

He finishes ordering and lights it up.
Watanabe
So?
Arishima
Hm?
Watanabe
Why'd you choose me to be your beer buddy for the first time in a quarter of a century?
Arishima
Oh...
Watanabe
You wanna talk about something we can't in the smoking area?
Arishima
Not really. I didn't wanna talk about anything in particular.
Watanabe
Oh, really? I thought you were gonna make sure I kept my mouth shut or something.
Arishima
No?
Watanabe
That was a second-year girl, right?
Arishima
Oh, you know her?
Watanabe
Everyone does.
Arishima
Why?

I realize how stupid of a question that is upon uttering it.

She's the daughter of Hatano Shuho.

Of course people at the academy would know.
Watanabe
I mean, she's got that air about her.
Arishima
By that you mean...?

Watanabe's answer isn't what I expected at all.
Watanabe
I mean, she's the daughter of someone famous, right?
Arishima
So it seems.
Watanabe
Whole different world from us plebs, you know?
Watanabe
And she's a looker to boot. Bet the girls in her class are jealous as heck.
Arishima
Jealous? You know anything?
Watanabe
Nah, it's not like I've actually seen her get bullied. Actually, I've never seen her with anyone, period.
Arishima
You really keep an eye on everything, huh?
Watanabe
Nah, it's not like I know every single person on campus. She's just such a looker, it makes you curious, you know?
Arishima
You don't say...
Watanabe
Wonder if her parents are celebrities or something.
Arishima
No...

I take another sip of my beer.

Watanabe waits for me to keep going.
Arishima
A writer.
Watanabe
Writer? Like, one of her parents is a novelist or something?

I nod.
Watanabe
A famous one?
Arishima
As famous as they get. A lot of movie adaptations of their novels, and they appeared on TV a lot, too.
Watanabe
Oh, gotcha. So a best-selling author. Sounds like a celebrity to me.
Arishima
Yeah.
Watanabe
Must be rolling in cash, huh?
Arishima
I suppose. The novels are still selling well today, as far as I know.
Watanabe
I guess she wouldn't come drink at a crummy bar like this.
Arishima
Maybe you're right.
Arishima
Her parents divorced and her dad passed away. She seems to have enough money to get by, and a fair amount more.
Watanabe
A whole different world from us, huh?
Arishima
It's not like she chose to be that way.
Watanabe
Life sure is unfair.
Arishima
...I wonder if that kind of life is a happy one.
Watanabe
Hmm, nah.

Watanabe chugs the remaining half of his mug in one go.
Watanabe
Being a slightly poor dumb dummy is the happiest life I can imagine.
Arishima
...Perhaps.

We keep talking about all kinds of things until my sixth mug arrives.
Watanabe
You can actually hold your drink, huh?
Arishima
You think so?
Watanabe
You're drinking more than me.
Arishima
It's been a while.
Watanabe
You like drinking, don't you?
Arishima
Yeah, I do.
Watanabe
Then why don't you do it more often?

Watanabe finishes his fourth mug.
Arishima
My wife gets in a bad mood if she smells alcohol on me.
Watanabe
Huh? Why?!
Arishima
That's just how it is.
Watanabe
Marriage?!
Arishima
No, me and my wife.
Watanabe
Why don't you split?
Arishima
Hahahah...
Watanabe
Nice nervous laughter there.
Arishima
No, I think you're right.
Watanabe
It's not like you're out here doing anything bad. Why not let you drink sometimes?
Arishima
...Yeah.
Watanabe
Think she just enjoys having you on a leash?
Arishima
No, not anymore.
Watanabe
Oh, I see.
Arishima
Well, I can understand why she's that way.
Watanabe
What do you mean?
Arishima
I was never able to meet her expectations.
Watanabe
Huh? You mean having kids?

I shake my head.
Arishima
My wife's an editor, and I wanted to be a writer. None of my stuff ever sold.
Watanabe
Oh, I see. So she was counting on you for a bestseller.
Watanabe
Why not start writing again now?
Arishima
...It's not that easy.
Watanabe
But you used to write in college, right? I mean, if you got an editor to marry you, it couldn't have been that bad.

Watanabe asks as he pops a piece of fried chicken into his mouth.
Watanabe
I've never written much besides essays when I was a student. If you told me I had to write something now, I wouldn't even know where to start.
Arishima
That's not true. Anyone can write if they just start and keep at it.
Watanabe
Then why can't YOU write?
Arishima
...

Yeah, why can't I?
Watanabe
Is it kind of like when a pitcher breaks a shoulder bone?
Arishima
...

No, I never wrote enough to break any proverbial bones.
Arishima
I'd say it's more like a car that hasn't been started for many years.
Arishima
All the parts are rusty, it has no gasoline, it needs oil, and the battery is dead.
Arishima
It'd be faster and cheaper to just buy a new car.
Watanabe
Makes sense.
Arishima
You're a new car. That's why it'd be easier for you to start.
Watanabe
So your wife's the type that keeps repairing and riding the same old raggedy car, then.
Watanabe
All while complaining about how much fuel it eats.
Arishima
No...
Arishima
Not really. She's the type to switch to a newer model each year.
Watanabe
Uh, for real?
Watanabe
You mean like, um, she goes out of the house to pick up new cars and rides them around?
Watanabe
Uh, I didn't mean riding, you know, like THAT. I mean in the sexual sense.
Arishima
Isn't that the same meaning?
Watanabe
Right.

I shake my head again.
Arishima
It's a possibility. I don't know for sure. And she's a rational editor. I could hardly blame her.
Watanabe
...
Arishima
What is it?
Watanabe
Nothing. I'd say you have some talent.

I stare at him.
Arishima
Why do you say that?
Watanabe
I mean, you were that new car once, right? And she rode you then, right? Even saw enough promise in you as an editor to put a ring on it.
Arishima
...
Watanabe
Japanese cars are made of sturdy stuff. I've seen ones still chugging after twenty years on the road. Horses, though, that's a different story, especially in the cowgirl position.
Arishima
...

Watanabe fills the silence by chugging down a whole mug of beer and ordering another.
Watanabe
What kind of stories did you used to write? Gimme an example.
Arishima
I don't remember.
Watanabe
You're a terrible liar.
Arishima
I don't remember being proud of anything I wrote. It was just a string of flops.
Watanabe
But you still managed to land a wife. And she's a rational editor, according to you.
Watanabe
It's been twenty years; you're not the same person anymore. It's like a completely different person wrote those flops!
Watanabe
If you read them now, maybe that'd remind you why that wife of yours fell in love with you in the first place.
Arishima
...I see what you're trying to say.

I take another swig from my mug.

Oh, it's empty.

Watanabe taps on the panel again and orders another beer.
Watanabe
Man, we've known each other for years, but this is the first time I'm hearing about all this.
Watanabe
The drinks are good, huh?
Arishima
Yeah.
Arishima
The company makes them better.
Arishima
...

Sinking into the sofa, I let out a huge sigh.

It's already past midnight.

Watanabe and I hit up another bar after that.

We drank deep into the night and shared some laughs.

But the fun times are already gone, leaving only silence and fatigue.

I stare at the ceiling in silence.

I have work tomorrow.

Just like always.

It's depressing to think about right now.

Tonight might be the first time I ever talked to anyone about my wife.

Back when we met, I...

Was there anything to my writing?

After blinking a few times, I sit up.

I go to the small spare room.

It's been two years since I last entered it.

It's filled with furniture we don't use anymore.

And stacks of unread books.

I move away piles of stuff until I find a box of things from college.

I open the lid.

Inside, I find a notebook with a time-weathered cover.

It's the notebook I used when I was a student.

I flip through it.

Back then, I was constantly jotting down ideas for my writing.
Rin
I'd like to read your writing, though.
Arishima
...

She wanted to read what I wrote.

The first person who ever said that to me...

...was my wife.

We were both young at the time.

If I wrote something now, would she read it?

I shake my head at my own question.

It's not her fault.

It's just too late.

Hm?

Sifting through an old photo book, I suddenly recognize someone in the background of a photo.

Hatano Shuho.

It looks like he's having a good time. His smile is broad and he seems relaxed.

That's odd.

I never saw him look like that after he became a writer and appeared on TV.

It's a small paper album you could pick up anywhere.

There are other photos of him in here too.

Oh yeah, back then...
Arishima
The awards party.

I mutter to myself.

All the members of the seminar got together when he won the Rookie Award that year.

In all the pictures from that party, he's happy and laughing.

I see. So he was as happy as anyone would have been after his debut work received so many accolades upon release.

The hazy memory becomes clearer the more I think.

That's right.

I was feeling really bummed out during this celebration, and my wife was the only one who struck up a conversation with me.

She noticed something in me, so she sat with me and we talked all night.

The main star of that party was Shuho, but she probably didn't exchange so much as a word with him.

After that party, we started to hang out and go for dinner together, and soon we started officially dating.

I leave the photo album open and rummage through the old case.

I find a collection of essays from when I'd just joined the seminar.

The anthology was put together for an open campus day.

I look at the table of contents.

Shuho's name is there.
Arishima
...

I flip through the pages, but my eyes just glaze over.

I get up, put all the stuff back in its place, and take the album and essay collection with me.

As I exit the room, I hear my wife climbing up the stairs.
Shouko
...What are you doing?

She regards me suspiciously.

She's in a bad mood.

I realize straight away from the way she's looking at me.
Arishima
You're back early.
Shouko
I have to go to Osaka tomorrow, so we wrapped up early today.
Arishima
I see.
Shouko
You stink of alcohol. Were you drinking?
Arishima
Yeah.
Shouko
...

She looks down at what I'm holding.
Shouko
What's that? An anthology?
Arishima
Oh, yeah.
Shouko
...
Arishima
I just felt like reading it after seeing everyone at the memorial service.
Shouko
Hah...

She gives an emotionless answer and walks past me, clearly done with the conversation.
Arishima
Hey.

I call out to her.

She looks over her shoulder at me.
Arishima
Maybe...
Shouko
You think you can still write?

She interjects before I can say anything else.

Her cold gaze pierces me.

I simply sigh.
Arishima
No. I just wanted to read my old stuff.
Shouko
What, you wanna find out if you wrote a masterpiece that somehow went under the radar?
Arishima
I don't...
Shouko
Say, do you know what kind of people are most confident in their writing skills?
Arishima
Uh, what?

I stare at her in surprise.
Shouko
The people who have never written anything before.
Shouko
Those who have never faced their own writing feel so confident in themselves.
Shouko
While you're out drinking and sleeping your life away, writers write. They never stop. Did you know that?
Arishima
...

Of course I do.

But I faced my own writing.

At the very least, I didn't run from my own weakness.

I accepted the fact I couldn't write and chose to become a teacher.

I never cheated or did anything that would destroy our married life to this extent.

I contribute to our joint account every month without fail.

So why?

Why does she look at me with so much hate?
Arishima
I know. I'm not planning to start writing right now.

After hearing this, she looks away from me and goes to her room.
Arishima
...

I drop my gaze to the album and the anthology I'm holding.

Inside the album, there's a photo of my wife when she was young.

And beside the smiling girl, a boy, clearly confused and excited.

These two people no longer exist.

There is no point in this photo existing.
