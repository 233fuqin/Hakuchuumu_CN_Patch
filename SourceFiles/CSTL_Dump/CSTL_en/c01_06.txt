Arishima
...

Over the course of the night, I made love to Rin many times.

Even while taking a shower together we sought each other, and after moving to bed, we greedily wanted more.

With each round, she gained more confidence, became more assertive and aware of what made me and her click.

She spread her legs wide on top of me, writhing her slim body and moaning with pleasure.

At the end of it all, I fall into a deep sleep, completely spent.

I wake up to find Rin reading the manuscript next to me.

I get up and leave the bedroom.

Recovering the shirt I haphazardly threw to the floor of the dressing room yesterday, I retrieve a cig from its pocket.

It's a little crumpled from getting wet and drying out again, but it'll do. I pop it in my mouth, go to the kitchen, and light it up below the ventilation fan.

Part of the paper is discolored.

And the filter feels really squishy. Must have been the water.

As I look up at the smoke getting sucked out by the fan, I remember Rin as she was last night.

I can still hear her calling out my name.

The way she straddled me with her legs open wide and looked down at me with a satisfied smile on her face.
Arishima
...

The memory is so vivid I can feel my pants getting tight already.

I close my eyes and try to keep her away from my thoughts, to little success.

I finish smoking and turn off the fan.

Returning to the bedroom, I stare at her from the doorway.

She's silently reading the manuscript.

She has only a few pages left.

Did she not sleep?
Arishima
I've got half a mind to brew some coffee.

She raises her face from the papers.
Rin
There's some drip coffee left from last time.

I nod.
Arishima
I'll use that. You want some?

She slowly shakes her head.
Rin
I'll make some for myself when I'm done reading. Go ahead.
Arishima
All right.

She smiles at me before turning her attention back to the manuscript.

I sit at the table and stare vacantly at the ceiling and walls while I drink my coffee.

I stay there a while after finishing until Rin shows up holding the manuscript.

All she's wearing is a T-shirt as she pads around barefoot.

Memories from last night flash through my mind and I quickly look away from her.

I'm not sure if she noticed or not, but she directs a suggestive smile at me and sits across the table.
Rin
I think I would like you to do me some, after all.
Arishima
...
Rin
Coffee.
Arishima
Sure.

No way that ambiguous wording wasn't on purpose.
Rin
Give me some?
Arishima
Of course.

I get up and brew her some more coffee.

I glance back at her as she looks out the window.

On the table rests my empty mug and the manuscript.
Arishima
Here you go.

I set the mug in front of her.
Rin
Thanks.

She looks up at me and smiles.

I sit down opposite her and watch as she sips her coffee.

She's wearing that funny daruma bird T-shirt that I bought for her in Sakuragicho.

She puts the mug down on the table and sighs.
Rin
I read it.

I nod in response.
Rin
...

Clasping the mug with both hands, she looks up at me.
Rin
It was really good.
Arishima
...

Loose-jawed from the surprise, I simply stare at her.
Rin
I think this writing is really good. I don't think it'd make for a good book as it is right now, though.

I nod, still unable to say anything.
Rin
Reading it, I fell in love all over again.

She says, the sweetest of smiles adorning her face.

In my shock, I'm unable to do much besides let my gaze swim and my mouth flap like a fish's.
Rin
Ahahah! What is it? Cat got your tongue?
Arishima
No, err, I just...

She giggles, her eyes still set on me.

I feel so uncomfortable.

And yet, at the same time, so happy and at peace.

Even though I know I'm just dancing on the palm of her hand right now.
Arishima
I didn't expect praise like that from you.
Rin
You're such a bad liar. There's no way you could have written that unaware.
Rin
I bet you knew I'd read it and fall hopelessly in love with you. There's no doubt in my mind.
Rin
Am I wrong?
Arishima
Err, I...
Rin
Could it be that this was your intention all along?
Arishima
Not at all.
Rin
That's a little hard to believe, judging from the night we had.
Arishima
I think I would've taken a shower first if that's what I was planning to do.
Arishima
And I would have actually bought some protection while I was at the convenience store.
Rin
Ahahah!

Visibly amused, she laughs out loud.
Rin
Good response!

I nod.

And she nods back cheerfully.

She puts the mug to her lips and keeps sipping.
Rin
Thank you.
Arishima
Huh?

She murmurs, looking down at the table.

I notice that her tone of voice has changed.
Rin
I could really feel just how much love you have for me.
Rin
Your writing made me feel the peace of mind one usually only feels after being loved for years.
Rin
Reading it made me feel glad to be alive.
Rin
And it's thanks to you.

She lovingly looks into my eyes as she speaks.
Rin
It made me feel like maybe, if there's someone out there who loves me so much, being alive a little longer wouldn't be so bad.

Unable to find the words, I simply keep nodding in response.
Rin
I felt your love in a deeper way than all the times you made love to me. Though I enjoyed that in its own right as well.

She lets out a devilish giggle.
Arishima
...I'll get in shape so I can satisfy you.

She nods, a sly grin spreading across her face.
Rin
I'll be waiting with bated breath.

After that, she takes another sip of coffee.
Rin
Have you decided what to do next?
Arishima
What do you mean?
Rin
What to write.
Arishima
Nah.

I shake my head.
Arishima
I haven't thought about it at all. To be honest, I feel like I've let everything I had bottled up inside out.
Arishima
When I was writing, I couldn't think about anything but the words before me, and you.

She smiles.
Arishima
I haven't decided what to write, or if I'm even gonna write again at all.
Rin
I think you should write.
Rin
I'm sure you should.

She sounds so matter of fact about it.
Rin
If you could put your feelings to paper like that just to show them to me, I'm sure you can write anything.
Rin
If you found a message that made you feel strongly enough, I'm sure you could write something that would appeal to the general public instead of just me.
Arishima
But I don't have a message that would interest the general public like you say.
Rin
That's a lie if I've ever heard one. Right here in these pages, you wrote about so many things in life you're dissatisfied with.

She points to the manuscript.
Arishima
...
Rin
I want to read even more of your writing.
Rin
And that's why you've gotta write. How else can I read more?
Arishima
...

I could stare at that smile all day.
Arishima
Okay, but...

She cocks her head and looks at me curiously.
Arishima
But next time we've gotta read each other's writing.

She opens her eyes wide in surprise.
Rin
You want me to write something too?
Arishima
I'd like that. Otherwise I can't read your writing either.
Rin
No way.
Arishima
Hahahah!
Rin
What's so funny?!
Arishima
Nothing, I just kind of think...

I stare into her eyes.

She meets my gaze with her own.
Arishima
I think you can write. I think you should. I'm sure you could write some good stuff.
Rin
Because I'm the daughter of a famous writer?

I shake my head.
Arishima
Because you're that kind of person. Your blood has nothing to do with it.

She giggles and gives me a small nod.
Arishima
I think you should. And more than that, I want to read it.
Rin
But...
Arishima
If you write, I'll write. Sounds like a fair exchange to me.
Rin
You really think I can do it?
Arishima
I know you can.
Rin
...

Rin seems to be in deep thought.

Then she quirks the corners of her mouth and gives me a mischievous smile.
Rin
So, say I do manage to write something... I'd like a reward for my effort.
Arishima
Really now?

She nods.
Arishima
Well, if I can make it happen, then sure.
Rin
You've gotta submit your next work for a rookie award.
Arishima
...

I stare at her in disbelief.
Rin
If you promise to do that, I feel like I could give it my best shot.
Arishima
Rin, I...
Rin
Oh, come on! It's a fine goal, no? Let's do it during the summer break.
Rin
If I can finish writing one piece, you'll submit yours for a rookie award.
Rin
It'll be our summer battle.
Rin
I bet it'll make for one memorable summer, right?
Arishima
...
Rin
We're on, then!

She gives me a playful smile.
Arishima
You got me good, huh?
Rin
Oh, and one more thing.

She gives me another one of those smug, sly looks.
Arishima
What?
Rin
Put something on. You're gonna get me all hot and bothered remembering last night.
Arishima
...
Rin
Are you doing it on purpose?

She says, dexterously raising one eyebrow at me.
Arishima
Oh...

I clear my throat.

At the ripe old age of 45, I find myself clearing my throat after being caught with my pants down, literally.

I use the washing machine in Rin's house to clean my clothes. One single button press and it does all the work. Truly, we have come far as a species.

After changing into my now clean clothes, I head to Shuho's studio to pick up my bag.

It's still pretty early.

I had lunch with Rin while I waited for my laundry to be done.

Rin said that she would make dinner tonight.

I think she's out shopping while I go get my stuff.

Now that I think about it, it'll probably be the first real meal I've had in a good while.

I feel strange.

My feet are so light they barely feel attached to me.

I have so much to think about.

I skipped work without explanation.

I'm now in a relationship with a student.

And the woman I'm in the process of divorcing saw me locking arms with her.

If I'm not careful, I might have a lot of explaining to do.

The worries pile up and make me want to sigh, yet my heart feels radiant.

Maybe the part of my brain that regulates anxiety is truly broken.

Like a junkie in the middle of his high.

But there is something that backs up this peppy spring in my step.

Rin herself. And while it's true that she's in my life for now...

Despite my obvious lack of morals, I'm a grown man.

I know that her fiery passion won't last forever.

But that's fine.

It doesn't deter the happiness I'm feeling.

As long as she lives on somewhere, and she's happy in the future, I will be too.
Arishima
...

When I take my first step inside the studio I freeze, stunned.

Was the air in this place always so stagnant?

Did I really find this space comfortable?

I shudder.

My stench after spending all that time here unwashed hangs like grime clinging to a wall.

Intermingled with it is the scent of death.

No one can stay in this place.

That's what my instincts tell me.

I feel the stomach-churning fear of a person who unknowingly crosses a flimsy log bridge with a blindfold on, only to look back and realize how lucky he was.

One wrong step, and I would have been dead.

Subconsciously, I recognize the danger I was in.

This heavy atmosphere crushes the spirit.

No amount of ventilation could save this place.
Arishima
...

I collect my laptop from the desk and throw the bag over my shoulder.

Back at the entrance, I take one last look at the room.

Hatano Shuho wasn't the perfect man I thought him to be.

But the power of his writing was the real deal.

His memories have the power to pull the reader into the same state of mind that he was in.

That's a power I don't have.

And I don't think I want it anymore.

I don't want to make Rin feel even an ounce of the suffering I did.

I want to deliver her a story of salvation, even if it's make-believe.

Even if it's not to remain with her for long, a story that could, just for a moment, light up her heart.

I don't mind being a shallow minstrel.

Shuho's diaries, his creative materials and reference books.

I slowly look it all over, committing to memory this room that I won't ever see again.
Arishima
...I wish we could have shared drinks when you were still around.

I mutter that to the silent room, and turn off the lights.

On my way to the front door, my gaze wanders towards the bathroom.

Through the polished glass, I can clearly see the darkness that lies within.

The life-engulfing darkness lies there, like a bottomless pit, spreading out into the beyond.

I won't come here again.

I'll give the key back to Rin.

I put my shoes back on, leave Shuho's studio, and lock the door behind me.

When I make it back to Rin's apartment building, my phone vibrates.

I expect it to be a message from Rin, but I'm wrong.

It's an email in my inbox.

I'm unable to contain my laughter when I read it.
Rin
Welcome back.

When I open the door, Rin comes over to greet me.
Arishima
Nice to be back.
Rin
You barely packed anything.

Surveying my luggage, Rin giggles to herself.
Arishima
I was only planning to stay the weekend.
Rin
Well, we're in summer break now.
Arishima
Oh, really? It slipped my mind.

At the time I was absent from work and Watanabe called, there should have been three days left until the end-of-semester ceremony.

I did feel like I stayed in that room for longer than three days.
Rin
It's been about a week since summer break started. You were holed up in the studio for ten days.
Arishima
Whoa, really?

I'm speechless.

She looks up at me curiously.
Arishima
When I went back just now...
Arishima
I was surprised at how oppressive the air was.
Arishima
I can't believe I was in there for ten whole days.

Rin nods, a smile of relief forming on her face.
Rin
I think that's the normal reaction to have.
Rin
I'm really glad you came back.
Arishima
It's thanks to you.

I take the chance to pick up the key from the bag by my feet and put it on the table.

She looks at it for a moment before realizing what it is.
Arishima
I think that, all in all, that studio had a positive effect on me.
Arishima
Coming into contact with Shuho's raw writing helped me convey my feelings to you.
Arishima
But I won't go there anymore. I can keep on living without Shuho.
Arishima
As long as I know you're somewhere out there, I can keep on going.
Rin
But I'm right next to you?
Arishima
I'm happy you feel this way about me. I know that you really mean it right now.
Arishima
But I'm not young enough to think this will last forever.
Arishima
I don't want to be a burden on you.
Rin
...

She simply stares at me in silence.
Arishima
Anyway...

I clear my throat and return her gaze.
Arishima
I don't need to chase after Shuho's shadow any longer. I'll write my next work because you said you wanted to read it. I wanna write it for you.
Arishima
I don't need the key anymore.

She gives me a slow, deliberate nod.
Rin
Okay, I'll take it back.
Arishima
Just know that I don't think you need to go to that studio either.
Rin
I think the same, yes.
Arishima
What do you wanna do? If you don't want the key, I can hold onto it.

I watch her stare down at the key for a moment.
Rin
I think it will take me some time...
Rin
But I don't feel as trapped as I did before. By my father, or by that place.

She says, her gaze fixed on the key.
Rin
Neither of us needs this key, but it'll be needed when the studio is sold off someday, so I'll keep it safe.

She says, raising her gaze to me.

I answer with a nod.
Rin
I went grocery shopping while you went to pick up your things. There's something I really wanted to make for you tonight.
Arishima
Oh, really?

She quirks a smile.
Arishima
Could it be mackerel?
Rin
Correct.

I watch from behind as Rin works in the kitchen.

She's so adept with the knife now that I can scarcely believe she was so clumsy not so long ago.
Arishima
Whoa...
Rin
Yes?
Arishima
How many fish have you prepared?
Rin
I forgot. I ate them pretty much every day. For both lunch and dinner a few times, actually.
Rin
The fishmonger even remembers me now. He thinks I just love horse mackerel.
Arishima
I can imagine.

Rin laughs as she cuts into the first fish.

Her movement is smooth and fluid as a brook.

She looks back at me, her eyes full of confidence.
Rin
How many points?
Arishima
A hundred, definitely. You're better than me. I don't think I can score you anymore.
Rin
Yes!

She has the sweetest of smiles on her face.
Arishima
You really hate losing, huh?
Rin
Yep!

Rin reaches out for the second fish, cleans off the scales, and starts filleting it.
Rin
I didn't ever want to lose to someone who looked at you with so much hate.

Rin says, just as she cuts the head off the fish.

I stare at it for a moment.
Arishima
Why?

She looks back at me.

I see a shade of uneasiness tinge her expression.
Rin
Why what?
Arishima
I said some horrible things to you that day.
Arishima
I was completely out of line, and I hurt you.
Arishima
I thought our relationship was over that day.
Arishima
But you...
Rin
...

She shifts her attention back to the fish, slices its belly open and washes away the innards.
Rin
I was really sad that day.
Rin
But I understood what you were saying.
Rin
You and your ex-wife...

Her knife glides across the fish's back, opening the way to its insides without a sound.
Rin
There's no way I can erase the time you spent with her.
Rin
That's why I started seeing it as a competition I didn't want to lose.
Rin
No matter how silly and childish it was.
Arishima
...

She finishes filleting the second fish.
Rin
I'm pretty messed up, huh?

She looks back at me.

Her smile is defiant and confident.
Rin
Almost as weird and messed up as you. Don't you think we're just made for each other?
Arishima
...
Rin
Right?

I nod in response.

Somehow, I feel as though I'm always nodding along with her.

The fish Rin prepared are cleaned well and have the perfect texture. Nothing less than absolutely delicious.
Arishima
It's really good. I'm amazed by what you can push yourself to achieve just because you don't want to lose.
Rin
Mhm.
Rin
Really, though, I was worried when you stopped responding to me.
Arishima
Oh, sorry about that.
Arishima
For not answering, and for yelling at you like that.
Arishima
I'm really sorry.
Rin
It's fine.

Her gentle smile makes me feel like things are gonna be all right.
Rin
I know how hurt you felt, too. You laid it all out in your writing.
Rin
And you came back, so...
Rin
Back then, when I sent the picture, you were in the bathroom, weren't you?

I nod.

I wrote everything in the manuscript that Rin read, even what happened in that bathroom.
Rin
My message reached you right before you went through with it, right?
Rin
If I was too early or too late, I'm sure we wouldn't be here right now...

Rin trails off.
Rin
It's like we had always been gears grinding against each other...
Rin
But that moment was the first time our gears meshed together.
Arishima
You may be right.

Our eyes meet.
Arishima
That's a beautiful thought. I'll remember that.

She blinks slowly and nods.
Rin
But...
Arishima
Hm?
Rin
There's a lot to think about now. About the future, I mean.

I let out a tired chuckle.
Rin
For example, what about your job at the academy?
Arishima
I think they'll let the whole being absent from work without permission thing slide if I grovel a little.
Arishima
But putting the moves on a student, that's a whole different matter.

She squints her eyes, a little astounded.
Rin
Obviously. We don't need to tell anyone about that.

I remember the first day I was absent, Watanabe was the one who called.

I need to get in touch with him later.

No, wait. He's probably in Yakushima right now.

Maybe it'd be a bad idea to call him about work in the middle of his vacation.

My eyes wander about as I think, but they settle on Rin.
Rin
Um...
Arishima
Hm?
Rin
Is your divorce finalized yet?
Arishima
...

She avoids my gaze.
Arishima
We're still in negotiations. But it's proceeding.
Arishima
I actually got an email from my ex-wife's lawyer just now.

Her expression goes from relieved to anxious in a moment.
Rin
Just now? What did it say?
Rin
Ah, um, if you don't mind talking about it, that is.
Arishima
It was about the house we had together.
Arishima
It'll become her property. I was notified that I have to vacate it before the month is over.
Rin
But why?
Rin
Is it because of what I did in front of her that day?

I slowly shake my head.
Arishima
That's got nothing to do with it.
Arishima
From the very start, I declared that I was willing to let them take care of the division of property as they saw fit.
Arishima
It happened because of me, just like I wrote.

Rin nods anxiously.
Arishima
...

Shouko may have seen what Rin did as a sign of me being unfaithful.

Perhaps she started feeling that there was no need to have mercy on me if we both were cheating on the other.

Whatever the case may be, this is all conjecture. I'll just make Rin feel guilty if I mention any of it.

She stands up and walks to the bedroom.

I can faintly hear her rummaging around on the other side of the wall.

After a moment, she comes back and sits down again.

And then...

She places a key on the table.

Again?

But this isn't the key to Shuho's studio.

It's...
Rin
The key to this house.
Arishima
...
Rin
For you.
Arishima
Rin, I don't think that's...

She shakes her head vehemently.
Rin
Why so shy all of a sudden?
Rin
Think of it as helping me be at ease. Take it.
Rin
If you don't, I won't be able to stop thinking about that day.
Arishima
Should I take this as permission to come and go whenever I want?

She slowly shakes her head.
Rin
I'd like you to live here, rather.
Arishima
...

She then turns her gaze down to the table.
Arishima
Rin, that's...
Rin
It can just be until you find another place to stay. Don't see it as a huge commitment.
Rin
Living in a hotel costs money, and it's better than sleeping under some bridge.
Arishima
...

I stare at her for a while.
Arishima
Man, I'm a failure as a teacher, huh?

I say, shaking my head in defeat.
Arishima
I'll look for a place of my own, though. I can't settle in a house that Shuho left for you.

A smile comes back to her face.
Rin
Then how about just during summer break?
Rin
We'll live together while we write our novels. Does that sound good?

I laugh at myself.

We humans don't change that easily, huh?

I'm more and more convinced of this.

I took her virginity, thoroughly made love to her for a whole night, and I'm still worried about what people might think.

And if I keep trying to appease some imaginary ethical boogeyman, at this point, all I'll do is make her feel lonely.

I nod in acceptance of Rin's proposal.
Arishima
All right.
Arishima
It'll be our very own writing camp.
Rin
Yes!

And so, the odd pair started living together.

I went back home, packed up the minimal necessities, and brought them back Rin's house.

The summer days roll by as we read books and take walks together.

After she makes dinner, I wash the dishes and brew coffee for us.

We drink coffee and work on our manuscripts before heading to bed and getting on with more pleasurable activities.

That's the daily routine we've gotten ourselves into as of late.

We didn't feel like going out today, so instead we're working on our laptops side by side.
Rin
...

Rin's manuscript isn't going so smoothly.

I sneak a glance at her.

She's looking down the screen, rubbing at her temples in frustration.
Rin
Professor?
Arishima
Yes?

I turn to her and wait for her to continue.

Her eyes stay glued to the display.
Rin
How does one even write a novel?
Arishima
If I knew that, I'd be rich already.

She raises her face and looks up at me.
Rin
But you can write!

I shake my head.
Rin
You literally did.
Arishima
I wrote something, sure, but that was more a letter than a novel. I'm no good at novels.
Arishima
Last time I tried to write, someone told me I couldn't depict people.

Rin shrinks back, realization dawning on her face.
Rin
...
Arishima
I wish I knew how to write a novel.
Rin
I shouldn't have been so arrogant...
Arishima
Hahahah.

She stares daggers at me.
Rin
What's so funny?
Arishima
Nothing.
Arishima
I can't wait to read what you'll come up with.
Rin
Why do you have to be so mean?
Rin
Stop it. You're making me too nervous to write anything at all, in case it turns out bad.
Rin
Some teacher you are. Aren't you supposed to help the students who are struggling?
Arishima
You're an honor student. No need to treat you with kiddie gloves.
Rin
You big meanie!

I laugh again.
Arishima
You read lots of books. For a start, how about you try writing something you'd like to read?
Rin
But I'm writing it for you to read.
Arishima
So? I want to know what kind of things you like to read.
Rin
...
Arishima
Well, I suppose I can hardly talk.
Arishima
If that kind of vague advice helped, I would've written my first novel long ago.

She nods.
Rin
Books I like, huh? Hmm, what kind of stuff have I read recently...
Rin
I just kinda read without thinking much, so nothing really sticks in my head.
Arishima
How about we go to a bookstore?
Rin
...
Arishima
Going out for a walk is good when you're having a little writer's block.
Arishima
And looking at bookshelves filled with different books to your own can be fun.
Rin
Right.

We decide to hit up our usual bookstore.

It's a twenty minute bus ride in the opposite direction from campus.

There's basically no one that could recognize us here.

We can't go around being too conspicuous in the areas around the campus.
Arishima
Remember we're writing for fun, first and foremost. Don't overthink it too much.

I turn to her as we walk down the sidewalk, and she giggles.
Arishima
What is it?
Rin
I remember saying something similar to you once.
Arishima
Oh, yeah.

The memory brings another bout of laughter.
Arishima
And you were right. Just write whatever comes to you. Don't worry too much. If you wanna sing, then you start by humming.
Arishima
Especially for people with your personality type.
Rin
Yes, all right.

Just like today, we've spent many a summer afternoon in this bookstore.

We go our separate ways at the entrance and wander around looking at whatever takes our fancy.

If either of us feels like going back, we reunite and go home.

And if we find a book that we really want to keep reading, we buy it together.

Today, each of us does their personal search.

Rin focuses on the "How to write a novel" section of a shelf.

I keep an eye on her from a distance.

I didn't think she'd struggle with creating something to this extent.

I'm seeing another side to her.

She can be very mature, but also very young in some aspects.

Those extremes live in balance inside of her.

Not having anything specific in mind, I eye the literature section.

In the foreign literature section, there are new books by writers that have been active since I was a student.

Now that's dedication.

For them, writing for an audience must be some kind of second nature.

Even now, they still manage to write interesting stories, and many of their works have been adapted to visual mediums.

Their books fly off the shelves like Shuho's.

But the difference between a person who is worn down by writing and one who grows with the experience only becomes more marked with time.

I move on to the section for new Japanese books.
Arishima
...

There, I spy a familiar name.

There are two stacks of different books by the same author.

One of them has a sticker that says "Over 100,000 copies sold! The new Hatano Shuho!"

I take a look at the cover.

It wasn't Shuho's name that I spotted, but the one of the actual author.

The name of that young writer who was talking at that event back then.

One of the books is published by the company Shouko works for.

The other one is from a major publisher.

The one with the impressive sticker is from the big publisher.

I pick up the books and take a look at the colophons.

The one from the big publisher is a sixth edition, and the one Shouko was in charge of a first edition.

Considering how big a print run for a new author usually is, there's a huge magnitude of difference between them.

I idly stare at the cover of the work edited by Shouko.
Rin
Professor?

I turn back to see Rin looking at the book besides me.
Rin
What's wrong?
Arishima
Ah, uh, nothing.
Rin
...

Her gaze stops on the sticker on the book, and she seems to realize something when she reads the name of the author on the cover.
Rin
Which one did your ex-wife work on?
Arishima
This one.
Rin
Mmh...

Rin takes the book from my hand, and reaches out for the one that's still laying on the shelf.
Arishima
Ah.
Rin
I'll buy them.
Arishima
You don't need to...
Rin
Not with my money. I'll use Shuho's royalties.
Arishima
...
Rin
Isn't this guy supposed to be his replacement?
Rin
Let's read it. I'm kinda curious. Not enough to use my own money, though.

Rin takes the books to the register with a slightly intimidating smile that doesn't leave any room for rebuttal.

We sit on a park bench near the bookstore and get to reading.

First, I read the book my ex-wife edited.

Even ignoring the fact that they're a commercially published author, this person is on the up and up, and leagues ahead of me.

There's not much to say about the story itself.

It's the kind of a story I've read before, in a style I've seen somewhere else.

That's all.

The publisher deemed it had commercial value and pushed it out.

You could say he's doing his job as a novelist well enough.

After reading the first fifty or so pages, Rin and I exchange books.

The work that apparently sold 100,000 copies is essentially the same as the one with Shouko's editing.

It's interesting how he managed to sell so many copies just with the backing of a big publisher.

Could it PR? Maybe the title for this one was more attention grabbing?

Again, I read the first 50 pages of the book, and then close it.
Rin
How was it?
Arishima
Mmh...

I take a glance at the cover.
Arishima
...I guess it's fine.
Rin
This author's your ex-wife's lover, right?
Arishima
Probably.
Rin
I like your writing way better.

I raise my head and look up at her.
Arishima
Thanks, that means a lot.
Arishima
But he's a professional novelist, and I'm not. I don't have any desire to be one either.
Arishima
If we use commercial value as the metric for how successful your writing is, I'm completely beat by him.
Arishima
At least, that's what I think.

She's staring straight at me.

She doesn't nod or shake her head.
Arishima
This book my ex-wife edited...
Arishima
I don't know if it sold well or not.
Arishima
But on some level, this writer must have responded to what my ex-wife wanted with this work. They probably learned to trust each other by working together, and that brought them closer together.

Like we never were, I remind myself.
Arishima
The kitchen of... what used to be our house was almost untouched, like no people ever lived in that house.

A slight frown touches her lips.
Arishima
No one cooked there. It was just a place for me to brew coffee and smoke.
Arishima
I... always felt guilty for never meeting my wife's expectations. That's why I never complained or asked anything of her.
Arishima
I think what I really wanted was to lead a happy life like everybody else.
Arishima
But when I realized my life was going nowhere and I wasn't happy, I just suppressed those feelings.

I stop there.
Rin
Because you betrayed her expectations?

Facing her, I nod.

Then I flip through the book's pages.
Arishima
I feel sad reading this. How could I have been so stupid for so many years?
Arishima
If I could have risen to meet her expectations like this, maybe I could have actually made it.
Arishima
I suppose that in the end, our marriage didn't amount to much more than the union of a failed writer and an editor with no talent.
Arishima
But...

I raise my head and look into Rin's eyes.
Arishima
That's in the past now. What happened between me and my ex-wife is just that. Now I'm with you, and I'm happy with the time we have.
Arishima
I've got no regrets.

We stay silent for a moment, with only the sound of cicadas in the background.

I gaze idly out at the people passing by our bench.

Eventually, Rin breaks the silence.
Rin
Professor.

I turn back to her.
Rin
Let's go shopping then head home.
Arishima
Shopping?

She nods.
Rin
For dinner.
Arishima
Oh, right.

We buy the ingredients for dinner at a small supermarket on the way to the bus stop.

As we step out of the store and I start to head towards the stop, Rin tugs on my sleeve.
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
Not that way.

She looks up at me, an innocent smile on her face.
Rin
We're going to your house today. It's the opposite direction, right?
Arishima
My house?
Rin
You walked there after you got off the bus the day we met, right?
Arishima
Yeah, but...
Rin
I'll make you dinner in that unused kitchen.
Arishima
...
Rin
There's no one there, right?
Arishima
Yeah, but next month...

It'll become Shouko's property.

I already got the official notice.
Rin
But this month it's still your house, right?
Arishima
...
Rin
If the kitchen in your house really is as clean as new, I want to use it.
Rin
That's okay, right?
Rin
Excuse me.
Arishima
Mhm.
Rin
Whoa, what a nice place.
Rin
The ceiling is pretty high. It feels nice and spacious.
Arishima
Come on in. It's nothing too fancy.
Rin
Okay.
Rin
Can I use the kitchen?
Arishima
That's what we're here for.
Rin
Can I use the tableware and everything?

I nod.
Arishima
Go ahead. I get the feeling they're going to the trash sooner rather than later.
Rin
All right.

I sit at the table and stare idly at her.

I had never dreamed that Rin would ever cook in this kitchen.

Noticing my gaze, she looks back.
Rin
What are you looking at?
Arishima
Nothing. Uh, it just feels kind of strange.
Arishima
You cooking in this house.
Rin
That's right. A girl who hasn't been alive for even half as long as you is cooking her heart out to make you happy here.
Arishima
...
Rin
Doesn't that make you the happiest man on Earth?
Arishima
It should be illegal to be this happy. Oh, is that the police on the door?
Rin
Ahahah!
Rin
The night is still young.
Arishima
...

Rin lines up dishes up on the table.
Rin
I think we've had enough rice for a while, and there would be leftovers, so I made pasta today.

She's prepared creamy pasta with mushrooms and salmon, and salad.

Plus bowls of clear soup.
Arishima
Looks delicious.
Rin
Can't eat with only one hand, though.
Arishima
You know I don't read when there's good company to share the food with.
Rin
Lucky for me!
Arishima
Can I dig in?
Rin
Go right ahead.
Arishima
Thanks.

I wrap a generous amount of pasta around my fork and bring it to my mouth.

I can taste Rin's cooking skill improving with each day.

And I'm not too prideful to let her know.
Rin
It's because I'm cooking for you. I never really tried when I was cooking for myself.
Arishima
I'm the same way. I just ate whatever when I was on my own.
Arishima
I think I only started really enjoying meals after we started living together.

Rin beams at me.
Rin
Is it like the dinner time that you imagined?
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
The happy life you must have envisioned when you bought this house.
Arishima
Yeah, it's that and much more.
Arishima
The food is amazing, and above all...
Arishima
You're with me now. It exceeds whatever I imagined when I got this house.
Rin
Not yet.
Arishima
Mm?
Rin
When we're done having dinner, we'll take a bath together...

I feel something warm sliding over my thigh.

Her toes are sinuously gliding their way between my legs.
Rin
Then we'll go the room you and your ex-wife slept in and do it all night long.
Rin
All wet from the bath. We're gonna do it like animals until we're too exhausted to keep going.

Her touch is setting my nerves on fire.

I gulp in anticipation.
Rin
I'll make you feel miles better than she ever did. And I'll make you moan louder than she ever could.
Rin
I'll make all the wishes you had when you bought this house come true.
Rin
Sounds good, doesn't it?

Slowly, she withdraws her feet.

Then, with that little mischievous smile of hers curling across her face, she returns to her pasta.

After the meal, we wash the dishes together and put the utensils back in their place.
Arishima
...Rin.
Rin
Mm?

She cocks her head and looks up at me.
Arishima
If you wanna make my dreams come true, can we add one more thing to our schedule for tonight?

She quirks the corners of her mouth into a sly smile.
Rin
Of course. What do you want to do?

I throw a glance at the living room, and then back at her.
Arishima
...I wanna write together.

Her eyes widen in surprise.
Arishima
It always was a dream of mine. To spend time together like that with the person I love.

She smiles sweetly and nods.
Rin
Okay, let's do that.
Arishima
Thanks.

I bring my paper and pens from my room on the second floor.

Rin brews us some coffee, and we sit opposite each other.
Arishima
Okay, let's decide on a theme and try to write a short story. Something that will fit within about five pages.

Rin nods dutifully.
Rin
Sounds fun.
Arishima
Don't worry about who's gonna read it. Just take it easy and write whatever you want.
Rin
Okay.
Arishima
Think you can do it?
Rin
I'll try.

I nod in response, take a sip of the coffee Rin brewed, and pick up my pen.

For a while, she seems deep in thought with her chin resting on the palm of her hand, but she starts writing before long.

I glance at her from time to time.

She's scribbling furiously. I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up with ten pages.

Looks like she's onto something.

I go back to my own paper, trying to hide my smile so she doesn't get distracted.
Rin
...
Arishima
Done?

Rin nods, blowing out a satisfied breath.

I smile at her in response.
Rin
It's short, but I finally managed to write something.
Arishima
What did you write?

She flashes a meaningful smile at me and makes that look she usually reserves for when we're in bed.
Rin
Wanna read?
Arishima
Is the sky blue?
Rin
Will you go easy on your criticism?
Arishima
My baseline will be the first evaluation you gave me.
Rin
You're gonna break my heart!
Arishima
I'm pulling your leg. I get it. That's not even the point here. I just wanna read something you wrote, that's all.
Rin
Okay.

She bashfully presents me with her manuscript.
Rin
I showed you mine, so now it's your turn.
Arishima
Gladly.

I hand her my manuscript.
Rin
Spending time together like this is fun, huh?

I nod and begin reading her story.

It's about...

A boy and a girl who have lived their entire lives underground, knowing nothing of the world above. One day they encounter a little bird and start to imagine the outside world.

It strikes me as an odd story at first.

But strangely enough, I'm fascinated by it.

I somehow feel like I know this story.

It's not a structural resemblance to something like The Blue Bird story. I just somehow get the feeling that I'm very familiar with the world she's depicting here.

Perhaps her ability to evoke a landscape is just that impressive.

The story ends with the little bird dying, and the two children digging a grave for it in the ground.

It reminds me of that empty birdcage in Rin's room.

Perhaps this story came from her own personal experiences, just like mine.
Rin
Have you finished?

Rin's voice snaps me back to reality.
Arishima
Yeah. It's a strange story, and a curious world you created here.
Rin
Yeah...
Arishima
However...
Arishima
Your writing made the scenery really vivid in my mind. It was so real, I felt like I knew it from somewhere.
Arishima
I really like this story.

Her eyes gleam brilliantly.
Arishima
Is this really the first time you've written a short story?
Rin
I've tried to write something like it a few times before.
Arishima
Figures.

She raises her face to look at me.
Arishima
It feels like you're used to writing, and...
Rin
...
Arishima
To be honest, I think you're talented. Now I'm looking forward to the end of summer even more.

A smile of relief touches her face.

I'm not just flattering her, and she seems to know that.

Her writing truly has a captivating and genuine nature to it that makes you want to keep reading.

It's nothing logical.

It's the spark of latent talent.

What I feel after reading this...

Is a little similar to what I felt after reading Shuho's story in that seminar anthology.

Maybe if I read this back when I was young, I would have been blown away.
Rin
It's really good.
Arishima
I think you should have more confidence. The pitfall people like you tend to fall into is underestimating yourself more than you should.
Arishima
It happens a lot. I think you should be more assertive.
Rin
There's such a thing as affinity when it comes to liking a piece of writing, isn't there?
Arishima
That's right.
Rin
When you said you liked it, it made me so much happier than if you had said it was good or bad.

I nod.
Rin
Your story was really fun to read too. Were you writing about this house?
Arishima
Yeah.

I wrote a story about an ordinary man who gets his dream home, and lives happily.

But in time, younger colleagues than him get nicer houses.

Others marry younger and more beautiful brides than his.

The ideal life he envisioned suddenly seems small to him, and he becomes completely fascinated by a leaflet promoting a condominium that he finds one day.

It's surreal little story that speaks of how society always makes us want more, even to our own detriment.
Rin
You really have a cynical bone in there, huh?
Arishima
I guess it's hard not to be when you've spent your time in the shade for so long.
Rin
Ahaha! But it adds a touch of personality to what you write. I wouldn't be able to come up with such a satirical take just from this house.
Arishima
I guess it's one of the perks of not being that talented. Can't help feeling like I gotta push back against it all.
Rin
But tonight you're going far beyond the ideals you had when you bought this house.
Arishima
...
Rin
You still have it in you to be this bitter about society?
Arishima
...Nice point.

She giggles and nods.
Rin
If you're with me, are you gonna go after a prettier girl when they show up?
Arishima
Never.
Rin
Ahahah! That's a load off my mind, then.

As usual, I'm overwhelmed by her.

Rin always knows how to take the initiative between us.
Arishima
But, uh...
Arishima
I think you could maybe keep going with this story a little longer, if you like. I think it's a nice thread to follow.
Arishima
Think you could write a second part to this?
Rin
Yeah. I think I may have a couple more things to write about for this story.
Rin
And I had lots of fun doing it today.
Arishima
Me too.

Suddenly, her gentle smile...

...fades away.

It feels like she's gazing at something deep inside my soul.

I meet her gaze with my own.
Arishima
...

Her eyes shift, and I notice she's staring at the album I tried to give her once. It's sitting on a shelf behind me.

I take a good look at her.

Perhaps she's thinking of that picture where my ex-wife and I are smiling together.

Silent, I simply gauge her expression.

She turns to me and gives me a little smile, a mysterious twinkle in her rose-colored eyes.
Rin
How about we take that bath?

Keeping her gaze pinned on me, Rin gets to her feet.
Arishima
S-Sure.

She walks up to me and gently takes my hand.
Rin
Let's go?

I nod as I feel my heart beat faster, and let her lead me by the hand into the bathroom.

We strip each other's clothes off and get into the shower, kissing passionately.

And after, without even bothering to dry ourselves, we drench the floor on our way to the second floor bedroom, where I push Rin onto the bed with an almost animal impulse.

She's lying in the same bed that once belonged to me and Shouko.

Rin smiles as she opens herself up for me. The shine of the lights does amazing things to her wet, glistening figure.

And just like she said, we spend the whole night making love atop the damp bed until morning comes and we give in to the sweet fatigue, still in a tight embrace.

At the end of August, nearing the end of summer break, I get in contact with Watanabe.

I get a response from him right away, and I tell him I'd like to talk.

He made time for me immediately, and we're supposed to meet in this cafe today.

I'm the first to arrive.

I sit in the smoking area, and Watanabe shows up by the time I finish my second cig.
Arishima
Long time no see.
Watanabe
You sure you oughta look so calm? What happened with work? You skipped the end-of-term ceremony, man.

I laugh in response.
Arishima
Guess I did. I never skipped a class even when I was a student.
Watanabe
And you thought it'd be cute to do it when you're a an old moose already?
Arishima
A lot of stuff happened, I suppose.
Watanabe
I can imagine.

I stare at Watanabe.
Watanabe
Well, I imagined you might do something like this, so I can't say it was a huge shock.

I nod and spread the divorce papers on the table.

So far, they only have my signature on them.
Watanabe
So I just gotta write down my name as witness and sign it?
Arishima
Apparently.
Watanabe
Okay.

Watanabe plucks a ballpoint pen from his bag and proceeds to carefully write and sign his name.

It was news to me that you needed a third party to sign divorce papers.

I was planning on telling him about the divorce anyway, after things calmed down, so I decided to ask him to be my witness.
Arishima
Sorry for asking you to do this out of nowhere.
Arishima
You're the only friend I could think of that I could even ask to help me with this.
Watanabe
Oh, so I'm your friend? What an honor.
Arishima
I wouldn't ask you if you weren't.

I fold the now signed divorce papers and put them in my bag.

With almost uncannily opportune timing, the waiter comes to take our orders.

Watanabe orders iced coffee.
Watanabe
So?

He takes a cig out of his chest pocket, lights it up, and pops it into his mouth.
Arishima
Mmh?
Watanabe
You've been well?
Arishima
Yeah, I'd say so.
Watanabe
Well, you don't sound so cheerful. What is it? Missing the wife already?
Arishima
Not at all.
Watanabe
Whoa, ice cold.

Watanabe laughs.
Watanabe
So, if you need a witness, that means there's no dispute over the mediation and all that, right?
Arishima
You're pretty knowledgeable about this, huh?
Watanabe
I kinda looked it up before coming here.
Watanabe
I guess it's good that it's not a messy divorce. Not like I know why you even divorced in the first place.
Arishima
Mm... Well, there was a trigger, but I don't think there was one concrete reason.
Watanabe
I suppose that's not unheard of.

The waiter brings his iced coffee and he begins sipping on it.
Arishima
How was Yakushima?
Watanabe
Pretty fun. Ah, sorry. I totally forgot your souvenir.
Arishima
Don't sweat it.
Watanabe
I'll bring it with me when we're back at work.

Watanabe stubs his cigarette out in the ashtray.
Watanabe
How about you? You go anywhere?
Arishima
Nah.
Watanabe
How about a change of pace, then? Traveling alone could help you feel better.
Watanabe
Why not let your hair down a little? Your wife kept you on a pretty tight leash, right?

I give him a bitter smile.

Oh, I've already let my hair down plenty. So much so that I may not be fit to be a teacher anymore.

I'm living at a student's home, and I'd rather not describe what we get up to every night under the covers.

But I've gotta keep quiet about all that, unless I want to lose the little bit of life I have left.
Arishima
I had my own kind of fun this summer break, I think.
Watanabe
Oh, really? What, you've been writing?

I nod.
Arishima
A lot of stuff happened, but I think life has gotten a lot more bearable. I'm enjoying each day now.

Watanabe looks extremely surprised.
Watanabe
Whoa, you really needed that divorce, huh?
Arishima
...Yeah.

I pay the bill in the end.
Watanabe
Thanks, boss.
Arishima
Don't worry. I went and called you out of nowhere for this.
Watanabe
Oh, by the way, what about your house? You weren't living apart, were you?
Watanabe
Did your wife leave? Or did you?
Arishima
...I think I gave the house away.
Arishima
I gave up my right to it and left the house. I don't know if she's living there with her new man or something.
Watanabe
Oh, I see. So you're living alone.
Arishima
Uh, yeah.
Watanabe
Is your new place around here?
Arishima
Yeah, I guess.
Watanabe
...

Watanabe's expression turns suspicious, and he frowns.
Watanabe
Arishima?
Arishima
What is it?
Watanabe
You're not living alone, are you? You're with someone!
Arishima
I'm alone, I swear.
Watanabe
Man, you're such a bad liar. You're not fooling anyone.
Arishima
...
Watanabe
So, what kind of person is she? Here I was all worried, and you already have a sweetheart waiting for you!
Watanabe
All you told me was how your ex-wife likes to ride around in fancy new cars and stuff.
Arishima
Right...

After thinking for a moment, I figure it's weirder to be so secretive, and decide to tell him the bare bones of the situation.
Arishima
I have a partner. She's letting me stay with her while I find a new place.
Watanabe
Yeah, right! You sly dog.
Arishima
I'm taking it easy. We read books every day and write together. It's a really nice life with her.
Watanabe
Huh? That sounds perfect for you. I'm happy for you, man.
Arishima
Yeah, I'm pretty happy. I can go drinking whenever, too, so feel free to invite me out anytime.
Watanabe
Sounds like a plan!
Arishima
You taking the bus or train?
Watanabe
Train. How about you?
Arishima
Bus, but I can come with you to the station and catch it from there.

We start walking to the station.
Watanabe
So are you gonna get married again to this mystery lady?
Arishima
Uh...

I shake my head.
Arishima
I'm not thinking about that right now. I feel like we're just sharing a moment in our lives right now.
Arishima
I'm not young enough to fall in love blindly like that. If she finds someone else that's more appropriate for her, I'll leave.
Watanabe
So it's someone younger than you, then.
Arishima
...Yeah.
Watanabe
Whoa, you sure mellowed out. Guess all it took was a divorce!

He sure knows how to make me chuckle.

Divorce wasn't all it took, not by a long shot.

It took almost killing myself and having someone read all my regret and negative thoughts about life to get me here.

But that's something I can't tell even Watanabe.

The whole story of the studio, and Shuho's diaries, and how it ended up with me being romantically involved with Rin.

As long as I keep working as a teacher, I can't tell anyone about this—at least not until Rin has graduated.
Watanabe
Hey, it was nice catching up.
Arishima
Same here.
Watanabe
You look better now. I'm glad to see some life breathed into those old bones of yours.
Watanabe
I seriously thought you might have died when you didn't pick up the phone.
Arishima
...

Watanabe has a discerning eye.

I never cease to be amazed by him.
Arishima
Thanks for the help. I'm living better now.
Watanabe
Make sure you keep it that way. See you in September.
Arishima
Yeah.
Watanabe
Give my regards to that sweet little girlfriend of yours.
Arishima
Will do.

Watanabe laughs one more time as he leaves for the ticket gate.

After seeing him off, I take out my phone and open the message app.

I'm heading back.

I send a message, and make my way to the bus stop.
Rin
...

I'm glad it happened when he wasn't around.

I tried not to worry about it, but soon enough there won't be any way to hide it.

The scents I like have changed as of late.

I used to like the smell of coffee, but now I can hardly stand it; I like the smell of oil now, too.

I feel drowsy all the time.

I've never been in the best of health.

I'm used to being sick from something most of the time.

I'm used to irregular menstrual cycles.

But...

It's never been so late before.

I still had an appetite, so I didn't think it was morning sickness.

But I vomited a lot today.

I looked it up, and the symptoms for morning sickness vary from person to person, but I have all of them.

But he always uses contraception.

Every day, except the first day we did it.

That was the only day he finished inside me.
Rin
...

I love him, probably more than he imagines.

If there's anything I know to be true in my heart, it's that.

But...

That's not the problem.

I can't even imagine myself becoming a mother.

I'm so scared of rejecting my child, like my parents denied my existence throughout my life.
Rin
...

I was stupid.

Maybe I wasn't ready to make love to him, after all.

Somewhere in my heart, I thought that only one time wouldn't hurt.

No, the desire to connect with him without anything in the way won out in the end.

I wanted him to love me more, to go crazy for me.

It never occurred to me that I would get pregnant from my very first time.

I was so dumb.

Why didn't I take the morning after pill?

I was foolish and ignorant.

And in the end, my stupidity might end up costing a life.

My hands tremble at the thought.

Unconsciously, I bring my shivering hands to my stomach.

I don't understand why I did that instinctively.

Holding my stomach, I sit down.

I want this all to be a misunderstanding on my part.

A mere coincidence.

Yes, it has to be.

I keep telling myself that, but the trembling doesn't go away.
Arishima
Hey there.
Rin
Oh, you're back.

I find Rin sitting at the table. She looks up at me and smiles.

She's holding her phone in her lap.
Arishima
That's odd.
Rin
Huh?
Arishima
The phone. I never see you using it, usually.
Rin
Oh, really?

I nod.
Rin
My generation are always on our phones, you know?
Arishima
I'm aware.

In the kitchen, I run some water into the kettle.
Arishima
Want some coffee?

Rin thinks for a moment, then shakes her head slowly.
Rin
I'll pass, thanks.
Rin
Was Professor Watanabe well?
Arishima
Yeah, he's as fit as a fiddle.

Rin wears a pleasant smile on her face.

After dinner, we both sit together to write on our laptops.

Ever since we wrote together that night in my old house, she's been hitting the keys at a constant pace.

For a while there, she seemed to have gotten into the groove of writing, but recently I've caught her staring at her screen in silence for long stretches of time.
Arishima
What's up?
Rin
Huh?

She raises her face from the screen and looks at me.
Arishima
Getting writer's block again?
Rin
Oh, no. I'm just thinking how to continue.
Arishima
Gotcha.
Arishima
You seem to have been going at a good pace so far. How much do you have left?
Rin
I'm wondering the same.
Rin
Whatever the case, I'll need to finish it before summer break is over.

Rin looks down blankly at her hands on the keyboard.
Arishima
What's it about?

At my question, she raises her eyes.
Rin
...Someone I've been trying not to think about, I guess.
Arishima
I see.

It seems that she's using her own experiences as inspiration.

Everyone's first work is more or less a projection of him or herself.

Perhaps, through her writing, she's looking for answers to questions she hasn't yet resolved within herself.
Rin
But I might change my mind and write something else. So I can't let you read it yet.
Arishima
No need to rush it. I'll wait for as long as you need.
Rin
Yeah, thanks.

After that, she turns to her screen and hits the keys for a while, but stops soon after.
Arishima
Tomorrow...
Rin
Huh?
Arishima
I'm going to see some places. Summer break's almost over.
Rin
Oh...

Her voice lowers to a murmur.

I answer with a simple nod.
Arishima
It'd be weird if I commuted to work from here.
Arishima
There are lots of single rooms to rent. I'm not picky, so I'm sure I can find a nice enough place.
Rin
...

Her eyes swim about the living room.
Arishima
I'll make sure to find something near here. You can come and visit me.
Rin
Yeah, I'd like that.
Rin
...

I let out a huge sigh, and it seems like my soul leaves along with my breath.

The moment I saw the result, my heart sank down to my stomach.

I simply stare in shock at the two lines.
Rin
Why?

I know why, yet I still ask the empty air.

If this was just me reaping what I'd sown, it'd be fine.

If I was the only one getting hurt, I wouldn't care.

But...

I press my hand to my forehead, feeling an imminent migraine coming.

I can't have a baby.

I can't be a parent.
Rin
I'm sorry.

The words spill out of my mouth for some reason.

I think they're directed at the life inside of me... and to him.

If anyone finds out that I'm pregnant with his baby, his whole life will change.

He may even come to regret ever meeting me.

Just like Hatano Shuho hated the woman that birthed me, he may hate me too.

I'm scared.

I'm sorry I don't have the courage to be upfront with you.

I'm sorry I don't have the courage to tell you...
Rin
I'm sorry...

Among the gynecology and obstetrics centers that I looked up, I found a few that don't require you to register with them.

One of them was run by a female doctor.

I came out of the west exit of Shinjuku station into an office district, and found the hospital after walking for a while. It was on the fifth floor of a tall building.

The doctor had long hair, and her features struck me as very neat and prim.

Before I could tell her I wanted an abortion, she put on an ultrasound image of my stomach on the screen.

I lay there on the hard examination bed and listened distractedly as she pointed to some little white dots, telling me that's the baby.

I stare at the image.

Unable to sort out my feelings, tears blurred my view.

I was trying to erase this child from the world.

I was trying to dispose of it, not even treating it as a life.

I was the only one who would mourn it.

Lying on the bed, tears rolled down my face.

After the ultrasound, the doctor explained the procedure for issuing a pregnancy certificate. As soon as she stopped talking, I told her that I wanted an abortion.

I told her that I had no parents and that I couldn't get a consent form from the father. I asked her to book me in for an abortion as soon as possible.

She nodded and informed me that it could be done as soon as tomorrow.

She explained that, if it's what I want, it's better to abort as soon as possible.

But if I change my mind, I'm free to cancel at any point, even on the day of the procedure. She asked me if I understood many times.

I interjected with nods and got up from my seat after she was done explaining.

She asked me I'd like to take a copy of the sonogram.

The doctor got up after me and handed me the photo.

It's just a little cluster of white dots contrasting against the black and gray of the background.

I trace my fingers over the tiny white blobs. They're so small I would have overlooked them if it wasn't for the doctor being nice enough to mark them with her pen.

This little life's whole world is me.

I wonder if the woman who gave birth to me also looked at me like this. A little white dot in a sea of dark.

What did she think, I wonder.

Maybe she thought she could use it to entrap Hatano Shuho.

Perhaps that's what she thought.

But...
Rin
...She gave birth to me.

I can't even recall her voice, but she gave birth to me.

The loneliness my parents forced on me has nothing to do with this baby.

If I reject them...

I'll become the same as my parents.
Rin
Can I...

I...

Can I be a mother to this baby?

I'm tired of walking.

My feet hurt like hell.

I visited three real estate agents and was shown seven apartments.

It took me all damn day in the end.

Now that I think about it, I haven't been out for a full day all summer long.

Since I'm spending the summer together with Rin, we should have gone on a trip somewhere.
Arishima
So they were pretty much the same when it came to amenities, but I never noticed before how much the thickness of the walls can change the ventilation and feeling a room has.
Arishima
Given my budget, I may as well go for one of those instead of a high-rise.
Arishima
High-rise apartments have such low ceilings to hide all the steel beams, and I like high ceilings because they help the place feel less cramped.
Rin
Oh, is that so?
Arishima
They also recommended something called weekly apartments. The procedure to rent one is easy, you don't need a lot of paperwork, and you can just give a down payment and not worry about annual income checks and all that.

I triumphantly dump all the house hunting knowledge I acquired today on Rin while she's preparing stuff in the kitchen.

She listens to all of it with a sweet smile on her face.
Arishima
And that was my day. How was yours? Do anything fun?
Rin
Shopping. I wanted to cook a proper meal for a change.
Arishima
Oh? But you always cook proper—and delicious—meals.
Rin
Oh, you know that's not true. I know I don't usually make a big, fancy spread, but I splurged a little today.
Arishima
We celebrating something?
Rin
No, not really. I just feel a little peckish today.
Arishima
Huh? That's a surprise.
Rin
Really?
Arishima
A welcome surprise, to be sure.

She lived up to her word.

A bunch of fancy looking dishes are lined up on the table today.

There's medium rare steak slices, mashed potatoes, bean soup, and a bowl of salad.

Even baguettes and butter.
Arishima
Whoa, this really is a feast.
Rin
Right?
Rin
Don't you think you could go out with no regrets if this was our last supper?

Rin says, as she sits in front of me.

That comment makes me think for a moment.
Rin
Well, our summer together isn't over just yet.
Arishima
Right.
Arishima
Our summer isn't over until we read each other's work.
Rin
I'll try my best.
Rin
Let's dig in.

I nod and bring a spoonful of beans to my mouth.

I notice that Rin doesn't drink any coffee after dinner today either.

I'm the only one drinking it.

After we're done with dinner, we settle down to write on our laptops again.

I'm currently revising my second draft.

After all that thinking yesterday, it seems she's finally continuing her story today.
Arishima
Looks like...
Rin
Hm?

When she stops typing for a moment, I get her attention.
Arishima
Looks like you made up your mind.
Rin
Really?

I nod.
Arishima
Feel like you can write now?
Rin
Yeah.
Rin
I feel like I know exactly what I need to do now.
Arishima
That's good.

She smiles at me.
Arishima
Summer break's almost over.
Rin
Mm?
Arishima
Why don't we go somewhere?
Rin
Somewhere?
Arishima
I mean, we haven't gone out much. It feels like kind of a waste of a good vacation.
Arishima
If you have anywhere you'd like to go, let's do it.
Arishima
Our last outing was in Sakuragicho, and I think I'd like to replace those memories with something more fun.
Rin
Ahahah, yeah.
Arishima
We can leave tomorrow, if you want. How about it?

She thinks for a moment.
Rin
Going on a trip does sound fun...

There's a glint of sadness in her smile.
Arishima
You have other plans?

Rin stares into my eyes.

Then she slowly shakes her head.
Rin
I'm not going anywhere. This is where I want to be.
Arishima
...
Rin
It's a nice idea, but we don't need to do anything special. I just want to be together at home, just like we've been this whole time.
Arishima
You sure?

She nods.
Rin
I mean, when summer break is over...

Her gaze wanders in the space between the two of us.
Rin
When it's over, all these summer days will become precious memories, right?
Rin
That's why... I want to stay like this.

I nod in response.
Arishima
All right. Then we stay like this. Tomorrow, and the day after that.
Rin
Yes.

Rin is aware that the time we're sharing is going to end.

And she's right that our lives will probably change as soon as the next semester starts.

Right now we're in our little period of grace.

If we're to build a truly strong bond, we must learn to coexist while also living our separate lives.

Now, whether we'll be able to do that will be tested when summer break is over.

We spent the last days of August in the same manner.

We read, wrote, and lived together in the same space.

We went about our activities, safe in each other's presence. And so, those dreamlike days flew by.

And now, it's the last day of August.

The last day of our summer break.
Arishima
Here's mine.
Rin
What kind of story is it?
Arishima
It's about a middle-aged man who decides he wants to run a marathon. The story is about the little changes you can see in yourself when you put in the effort, and the hope they bring.
Arishima
I think it's plain, simple, and doesn't really stand out from the crowd...
Arishima
But at least I mustered up the courage and patience to write even a shoddy little piece like this. Took me long enough.

I finish that last sentence with a little chuckle.
Arishima
If I started sooner, maybe I could've been earning my current salary from writing.

Rin nods, a little smile touching her lips.

I wait for her to say something.

As for her...

I see no laptop or papers in her hands.
Rin
I...
Rin
Couldn't write anything in the end.
Rin
I lost the summer battle.

My eyes widen in surprise.
Arishima
But I saw you writing? I thought you had the rest of it planned out.
Rin
Still, I couldn't write it all the way to the end. Not yet.
Arishima
Oh, I see.
Rin
But I'll complete it someday.
Rin
When I do, will you read it?

I give her a firm, deep nod.
Arishima
I'd love to read it.

She smiles at me.

Then she turns to look at my manuscript.
Rin
I didn't finish mine, but can I read yours?

I nod and present it to her.
Arishima
Of course. I wrote this for you.
Rin
I'm so happy.

She reads my manuscript until night falls.
Rin
It's such a refreshing story. Perfect for summer.
Rin
It's completely different from the things you're written so far.
Arishima
Uh, it's kind of hard to put into words, but I suppose I didn't go as hard with this one.
Arishima
It just kinda let myself write naturally. It's been a long time since I last had that experience.
Rin
Yeah, I can feel that.
Rin
Of the pieces you've written, I think this is the one I'd like to keep reading again and again.
Arishima
Well, I don't think there's much to get out of it from rereads. You probably won't come out thinking any different from it.

Upon hearing that, Rin smiles again.
Rin
I guess we have no regrets left from this summer.
Arishima
I have one. I couldn't read your story.
Arishima
That's one huge regret.
Rin
I'm very sorry about that.

I laugh, and she keeps on smiling.
Rin
I'll do my best so you can read it someday.
Arishima
Write it at your own pace. You gotta walk if you wanna run.
Arishima
Though I'm just repeating your words.
Rin
Hah. People who've never written anything always say the most insensitive things, huh?
Arishima
You bet.

Our laughter fills the room.

On that last night of our summer vacation, we make love one more time. We seek each other quietly, lovingly.

Afterwards, we lie on the bed together, the room comfortably cool from the air conditioner. I fall into a deep sleep while stroking Rin's head.

And that night, I have a strange dream.

I dream about a girl. A beautiful girl with white hair just like Rin's.

The girl lived in a room much like Shuho's studio.

The little studio has a completely different atmosphere from Shuho's, though.

It's almost as if her will to live just exuded from every little thing.

I stroke Rin's head while I stare at that slightly familiar scenery in the border between waking and sleep.
Rin
Mmh...

Rin wakes up and rests her cheek on my chest.
Arishima
I had a strange dream.
Rin
A dream?
Arishima
A girl that looked like you was writing a novel on her own.
Rin
A novel...
Arishima
Yeah... I think she was writing about us.
Rin
In a place that looked a lot like Shuho's studio.

I shift my gaze down to her.

Her upturned eyes are aimed straight at my face.
Rin
I think we had the same dream.
Arishima
Oh.
Arishima
Well, I suppose there's a first time for everything.
Rin
I know how she feels writing that novel.
Arishima
You do?
Rin
The feeling of wanting your loved one to read it...
Rin
And at the same time, the fear of laying yourself bare.
Rin
She's been struggling with those feelings for so long.
Arishima
...
Rin
For her, that novel is... a pure depiction of her deepest emotions. A story from the heart that tells more about her than a diary ever could.
Rin
And she's lost. Wondering if she should show that to the man she loves.
Arishima
What does she do in the end?
Rin
I don't know.

She looks up at me.
Rin
I woke up in the middle of the dream.

I give her a little nod and stroke her hair again.
Arishima
What would you do?
Rin
Me?
Arishima
Would you give that story depicting yourself to the person you love?
Rin
...

She takes a deep, silent breath.

I keep on softly stroking her hair.
Rin
If I could write it, I'm sure I would.
Arishima
I see.

When that happens...

Will the person she loves be me?

Or someone not even she knows yet?

Whichever it ends up being is fine by me.

As long as she's happy.

As I stroke her hair and sort through my thoughts, the sweet embrace of sleep wraps around us both.
Arishima
I'll go first.

Rin nods.

It's still really early to go, but we can't arrive on campus together.

There are some cafes that open early at the station.

I'll go kill some time in one of them.

I rented a weekly apartment near the academy and have decided to commute from there to work until I find a more permanent place.

I had the feeling that if I didn't find a place by the time the new term started, I would end up settling down in Rin's place for good.
Arishima
Can I come over during the weekends?

Rin smiles and nods.
Arishima
...I'm feeling really sad.
Arishima
I had the best summer in my life thanks to you.
Arishima
If I hadn't met you...

Rin waits for me to continue, looking slightly surprised.
Arishima
I would have just kept spending my summers doing nothing with my life.
Arishima
Thinking of that really scares me.
Arishima
I'm so glad that we met.

The corners of her mouth turn up into a small, relieved smile.
Rin
Aw, stop it. You're making it sound like we won't see each other ever again.
Arishima
Can you tell how hard I'm trying to stall for time?
Arishima
I don't want our summer together to end. That's how much I loved living together.
Rin
Yeah. I feel the same.
Arishima
Thank you. For everything.
Rin
...Yes.
Arishima
See you.

Rin nods.

With painful reluctance, I turn my back on Rin's home and close the door on my way out.

The moment the door closes, the tears begin flooding down my face with the intensity of a broken dam.

My legs simply give out beneath me, and I sink down onto the floor.
Rin
Uuuh... *Sob*

Why am I like this?

Why couldn't I believe in him? Why couldn't I let myself depend on him?

In the end, I'm not qualified to become anyone's mother.

I couldn't put my ego aside in front of him.

I don't want to take away his life.

I don't want to become a shackle on him.

I'm scared. The thought of him hating me is too much.

His heart healed. He's stronger now.

He'll be fine without me.

I won't ever forget the summer we shared.

That's why...

Please, forget about me.

I'll remember for the both of us, so please forget.

I left the house with a little time to spare, still dressed as I had been when I saw the teacher off.

I walk through the city after the waves of students heading to school have died down.

Over the past summer, I've grown to like this city a little more.

The café where I had my first meal with my teacher and the fish shop where he remembered my face are part of this city.

I don't know why I hadn't noticed it before.

It was a nice town, this place.

I'm glad I finally realized that.

The days I spent with my teacher made me realize that I was still a young child.

No matter how tall you are.

No, the taller she was, the more her infancy seemed to stand out.

All of my daily necessities fit into this small carrying case.

I wonder if this is the weight of my life to date.

With these thoughts in mind, I pulled my light carry-on case and headed for the station.

I walked to the end of the platform, which was sparsely populated.

Across the railroad tracks and over the fence, I can see the city of Yumemi, where I have lived until today.

I stared blankly at the city and the flow of people walking through it.

At that moment, I clearly felt that I was no longer a resident of that city.

They were people I didn't know, walking in a city where I didn't exist.

There is no place for me in this city anymore.

It was my choice. I didn't feel lonely.

From a distance, I could hear the sound of a train running.

It was the sound of a train carrying me and my child to the next city.

I put my hand over my stomach.

I smile, tears running down my face.

My hands are warm.

The one thing giving me peace is the child growing inside of me.

I...

I don't want to throw away my life like my father did.

I don't want to be a parent like that.

My parents left me unbearable loneliness and unspent money.

Wealth beyond anything I could ever accomplish.

Regardless of whether I want it or not, I have to live with it.

But I can use it to protect this baby.

I made up my mind.

I'll raise this baby myself.

I feel happy, overcome with a feeling that I can only assume is motherhood enveloping me.

It makes me feel like I can become whole.

I'm not alone anymore.

Having something to protect, I find meaning in life for the first time.

Yes...

It's thanks to him. He saved me.

Having this baby inside me made me stronger.
Rin
...I'll be strong. We'll make it.

I mutter to myself, gently stroking my stomach.

The train comes into the platform, blocking the view of the city I'm leaving.

The doors slide open. I stop for a moment, then shake my head.

And then, I step into the train.
