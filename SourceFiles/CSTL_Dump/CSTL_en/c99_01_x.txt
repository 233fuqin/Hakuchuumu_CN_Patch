Kaito
When does this 'role' end?
Izumo
When you finish the third dream.
Kaito
What?
Izumo
Each of the three dreams has an end. When the time comes, you will understand.
Izumo
Your dreams will progress.
Izumo
Like stories.
Kaito
...

I think back on the dreams from before.

They do feel like they have a sense of coherence and story-like progression, not to mention I can remember them eerily well.
Kaito
I don't understand this experiment.
Kaito
I'm confined here and given food and accommodations, just so you can record my dreams.
Kaito
And I agreed to have my own memory wiped to do this?

Izumo nods.
Kaito
What's it all for?
Izumo
You will understand when your memories are returned.
Kaito
...

I blow out an exasperated sigh.

The white-haired girl finishes her meal and lays her spoon down on the plate.

Then she simply stares down at nothing.
Kaito
Who is she?
Izumo
Her name is Yonagi. Her dreams are being recorded together with yours.
Kaito
So we're both test subjects?

Izumo nods again.
