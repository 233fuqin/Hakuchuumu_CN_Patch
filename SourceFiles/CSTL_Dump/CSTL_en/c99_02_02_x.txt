...

When we get to the table, Izumo presents us with the same boiled corn dish from before.

It dawns on me that we'll probably be eating the same thing for as long as we're here.

But it does taste okay, so it'll probably take some time for me to get bored of it.

The only sound in the room is that of spoons clinking against bowls.
Kaito
...Izumo.

She turns to me.
Kaito
Mind if I ask a few more things?
Izumo
Go ahead.
Kaito
It's about the dream.
Izumo
Yes?
Kaito
You know about these dreams I'm having, don't you?

She nods.
Kaito
I've never had such vivid dreams before.
Kaito
It feels like I'm really there. I'm really curious about it.
Izumo
Ask away. I'll answer as much as I can.
