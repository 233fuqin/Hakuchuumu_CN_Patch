Once we arrive at the recreation room, Yonagi trots over the the toybox and takes out some paints and a black camera before coming back.

She hands the camera to me.
Yonagi
I am the model, you are my camera man.
Kaito
Okay?
Yonagi
Use this to take pictures of me.
Kaito
Ah, okay. Gotcha.
Yonagi
I'll put on makeup first.

Then, she pats at her cheeks.
Kaito
What's that?
Yonagi
Make up.
Kaito
Oh, I see what you mean.
Yonagi
It's blush.

She says, lightly dusting a paintbrush over her cheeks.

Then she brings the brush to her mouth.
Yonagi
Lipstick.
Yonagi
Do I look cute?
Kaito
Very cute.
Yonagi
Okay.

Yonagi drops the brush and picks up another one.
Yonagi
Now I'll paint my nails.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
I'll make them sparkly.
Kaito
That sounds nice.

She starts using the paint on her nails.

The paint from last time has already come off.

It probably washes off with water.
Yonagi
And last, I'll do my hair.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
Chop chop.
Yonagi
Chop chop chop.

She pantomimes cutting her own hair with scissors.
Yonagi
Swoooosh!
Kaito
Swoosh?
Yonagi
I'm drying it.
Kaito
Oh, makes sense.
Yonagi
Pssshhh...
Kaito
And what's what?
Yonagi
Hair spray.
Kaito
Whoa.

An impressive effort for realism.
Yonagi
Okay, I'm ready.
Kaito
Gotcha.
Yonagi
Am I super pretty?
Kaito
Huh? Err, wh-why do you ask?
Yonagi
Am I super pretty?
Kaito
Y-Yeah, super pretty?
Yonagi
Yes!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Take my picture.
Kaito
Ah, right. Say cheese...
Yonagi
You gotta tell me how cute I am.
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
You have to!
Kaito
Ah... You're really cute.
Yonagi
Tell me I'm the best.
Kaito
You're the best.
Yonagi
Super pretty?
Kaito
You're super pretty!
Yonagi
Yes!
Kaito
Okay, I took the picture.
Yonagi
Nice!
Yonagi
I'll put on the next dress.
Kaito
Oh boy...
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Huh? Yonagi?

After we've been playing at modeling for a while, Yonagi starts rubbing at her eyes.
