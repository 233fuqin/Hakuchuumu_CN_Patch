Kanna
Mmh... Huh?

I sit up on the sofa.

Sunlight seeps in through the windows.
Kanna
It's morning?

Just then, there's a knock at the door.
Kanna
Ah!

Did I just fall asleep yesterday?
Kanna
Coming!

I dash over to the door.

When I open it, I'm met by a woman in a sleeveless top with a cigarette in her mouth.
???
A kid?
Kanna
Um...
???
You're the one who called for me?

The woman says lazily, almost slurring her words.

I simply nod.
???
Hmm...

She drops the cigarette and grinds it beneath her heel.
???
Where's the car?
Kanna
Oh, right. It's inside.

She walks into the garage with long,confident strides.
???
Ooh, what do we have here?

The woman approaches the car and drops her bag in front of it with a metallic thud.

Circling the car, she looks it all over.

Then she leans into the front, pops the hood, and peers inside.
???
So a genuine H-DT diesel turbo '91 Hachimaru. And it's a custom model for camping, huh? Pretty cool.
???
You did this? You even have a license?
Kanna
No. It's my Mom's.
???
Your mom? Mmh... So this is a girl's ride. This gets better and better.

The woman takes a piece of paper out of her pocket.

It's the request form I filled out.
???
So Amei Kanna would be you?
Kanna
Yeah, that's me.
???
Kanna, huh? So I can call you Candy Boy, right?
Kanna
Uh?
???
What about Candy Mommy? It's her car, right?
Kanna
Oh, yeah... I wanted to surprise her by fixing it.
???
I'd prefer to talk with the owner, if you wouldn't mind.
Kanna
...She's not here right now.
???
Huh...
???
I see. So you're a momma's boy that wants to do something sweet, then.
Kanna
Uhhh?

Is it just me, or this woman coming out with some weird stuff?
???
So, what's wrong with the car?
Kanna
It doesn't work no matter what I do.
???
Hand over the key.

I take off the keychain I keep attached to my belt and pass it to her.
???
Man, there's nothing like turning on a car by shoving the key into the ignition yourself!

The woman happily climbs into the driver's seat, muttering to herself as she inserts the key.
???
Mmh... The electrical system is alive, at least.
???
Let's see...
???
I'll be taking a look inside, okay?

She to the bag on the floor, takes out some tools, then returns to the hood.
Kanna
Can you fix it?
???
Mm, can't say yet. Gimme a minute.
Kanna
...

After taking a look at the engine, the woman takes some kind of device out of her bag and hooks it up to Hachimaru.
???
Mmh...
Kanna
How does it look?
???
This is... pretty bad.
Kanna
Bad?
???
Pretty damn bad.
Kanna
I see...
???
I'll take a closer look. Take a seat over there, Candy.
Kanna
C-Candy?

The diagnosis of the car takes far longer than I expected.

I sit on the couch and look over the photos I took the other day on my laptop.

The old Nariyama Airport Terminal is a great location.

It's nice that there aren't many people around.

It used to be an international airport, but it was closed down a long time ago.

All part of the history of Japan everyone learns about.

It's because of the artificial pigeons.

There's still a lot of them around. Always has been, as far as I know.
???
Hey, Candy.
Kanna
Candy...?
???
I'm talking to you, Candy Boy. That camera belong to Mommy Candy too?
Kanna
Used to.
???
Your mommy has some cool hobbies, huh?
Kanna
...

Hearing that actually makes me a little pleased.
???
Sadly, I have bad news for you. This car here's done for.
Kanna
Huh?
???
You know much about cars, Candy?

I shake my head.
???
Mhm. First of all, 90% of the cars in circulation today run on batteries. The only people using cars that run on gas are a few enthusiasts.
???
And how easy it is to get spare parts is proportional to how many cars of the same model are out there. You follow me so far?

I nod.

I'm about to say that I get everything but her nicknaming decisions, but decide against it.
???
From what I can tell, you could replace some parts with common EV car components, but most of the core parts are showing their age.
Kanna
Oh...
???
With the money you'd use trying to get those parts, you could buy yourself two cars brand new.
Kanna
Whoa, really?
???
Hachimaru's pretty popular among collectors, you see. There's a demand, but not much in the way of supply, so the price hikes up.
Kanna
But it was working until last year.
???
It was?! In this state?! Now that's a miracle!
???
That's the biggest surprise I've had all year!
Kanna
So, uh, what's the estimate? How much will it set me back?
???
Can't give you one. I can't guarantee it'll work even if I manage to get my hands on all those pricey parts. The risk's too high for both of us, don'tcha think?
Kanna
But...
???
That brings me to my offer. I know a buncha collectors that buy damaged cars.
???
As it is... how about 300K yen? You can go pick up a license with that money.
Kanna
Uh...
???
You'd have to pay a used car shop to get this thing off your hands, kid. It’s a good deal.
Kanna
That's not the problem!
???
What the hell? You're shrewder than I gave you credit for, huh? Got it! 400K! You're almost pushing me into the red there. How about it?
Kanna
I'm not selling it. I wanna make it work.
???
...500K. You can get yourself a license AND a used bike with that much.
???
You'll go places with it! You'll be a hit among the ladies! I can see it already!
Kanna
...
???
...
???
Argh, I get it! Man, you ain't sweet at all, Candy. I give. 550K, in cash, right now!
Kanna
Get out! I'm not selling!

I pick up her bag and push it into her hands.
Kanna
If you can't fix it, I'll do it myself! Get outta here, hag!
???
The name's Azuki!
Kanna
Wh-What? Azuki? Your name?
Azuki
I'm not some hag! My name's Azuki!
Kanna
I don't care!

I push the woman that calls herself Azuki out of the garage.
Azuki
H-Hey! Candy! Stop it!
Kanna
And don't come back!
Azuki
My tools! My scanner's in there! Hey!
Kanna
Haah... Haah...

What was with her?

I knew trying to rely on other was a mistake.

But this has at least forced me to accept one thing:

I'm gonna have to fix it myself.

I need this car.
Kanna
Is it really that hard to fix?

I walk up to Hachimaru, grab the key from the ignition, and hook the keychain back onto my belt.
Kanna
...

Nothing's going my way.

Not one single thing.

I just want to take pictures like my mom.

I just wanna drive this car like Mom did and take the perfect picture of the comet that she wanted to take.

But all my efforts are going nowhere.

Heaving a sigh, I face Hachimaru.
Kanna
What do I do? How can I fix you?

She said it's pretty bad.

That Azuki mechanic girl.

But what exactly is bad about it?

She said I could spend enough money to buy two cars and it still might not be enough to fix it.

How much does a new car cost?

I can't get that kind of money behind Dad's back.

I saved some money for repairs, but it's not nearly that much.

I climb up the ladder and lay down on the bed.

This weekend sucks major ass.

Everything's gone to hell.

I'm at a dead end.

I can't even seem to get drag myself to the starting point of becoming a photographer like her.

I'm in what used to be her workplace.

When I lay down in bed, I can see the roof of the garage through the sunroof.
Kanna
...

As long as this car doesn't move, I'll never be able to see the starry sky from here again.

Everything's going terribly.

If mom was here, I'm sure she'd encourage me.

She always helped me to think of things I never even considered before.

I wish I had treasured our little moments together when she was alive more.
Kanna
Mom, was the place before no good either?
Anna
Hm?
Kanna
I thought that Motosu place we went to last week was really pretty.
Anna
Yeah...
Kanna
We'll see Halley's Comet next year, right?
Anna
We sure will.
Kanna
Shouldn't you start narrowing down the area where you wanna take the photos?
Kanna
I mean, it only happens once every 70 years, right?
Anna
76, actually.
Kanna
...

She taps the ash off her cigarette and into a portable ashtray.

I keep looking up at her from the side.
Anna
Hey, Kanna.
Kanna
Yeah?

She exhales a thick cloud of smoke, then turns to me.
Anna
How would you like to be let in on one of Mommy's top secrets?
Kanna
A top secret? What is it?

My mom flashes me a sly smile.

When she does that, she looks more like a kid than I do.
Anna
Truth is, I already chose the location for the shoot. Long time ago, in fact.
Kanna
Really?! Where?!
Anna
That'll be a surprise for 2061!
Kanna
Whaaat? You can't just not say anything!
Anna
Too bad!
Kanna
You're such a kid!
Anna
That's fine by me.

Laughing, she puts out her cigarette.

Then turns towards my dad, who's fiddling with the car's engine.
Anna
Still not ready to go?
Dad
Nah...
Anna
Looks like we're stuck for a bit.

She takes out another cigarette and lights it up.
Kanna
But, Mom...
Anna
Hm?
Kanna
Why are we camping, then?
Kanna
You don't need to scout for a location anymore, right?
Anna
Well...

She looks at Hachimaru while puffing out little smoke circles.

I follow her gaze.

Dad is bending over to peer under the hood.
Anna
Because he's a hopeless, boneheaded klutz.
Kanna
Huh?
Anna
And because I hate losing.

Mom looks down at me and grins.
Kanna
What's that me—
Dad
Hey, Kanna. Come over and help me.
Anna
Oh, he's calling you. Go on.
Kanna
Okay.
Kanna
...

I feel a nostalgic rumbling.

...

Oh, this must be another dream.

Whenever we all went location scouting as a family, I'd always sit in the backseat and the car would jostle around just like this.

Mom always hugged me close to her when I fell asleep.

At some point, I started feeling embarrassed about it, and I'd get sulky and pouty when I woke up with her beside me.

I never thought she'd be gone so quickly.

I wish I'd let her hug me a little more.

Why did I ever bother trying to act like I was too cool for it?
Kanna
Mom...
???
Shhh! Kanna, be quiet!
Kanna
Yeah...
Kanna
...
Sumomo
...
Kanna
Momonouchi Sumomo?!
Sumomo
Shh! Did you hear me just now?! And why're you using my full name?
Sumomo
Sumomo's fine!
Kanna
What?! What's happening? Where are we?
Sumomo
Inside of your car. Shh!
Kanna
Why is it moving?!
Sumomo
Because a thief is driving it. Shh!
???
Huh?
Sumomo
Ah!

She pulls me closer to her to hide me from the person in the driver's seat.

Now her scent's all around me.

And something really soft is pressing against my face.

It's her peaches. Sumomo's peaches.

The soft, warm sensation along with the delicious scent overloads my senses.
Sumomo
I bet they plan to take you back to their lair then demand ransom from your daddy.
Sumomo
We're running away as soon as the car stops, okay? Can you run?
Kanna
Mguh... Mmh...
Sumomo
Hm? Kanna?
Kanna
Mgh!
Sumomo
Mm?

She relaxes her grip on my head and I'm finally released from her peaches.
Kanna
Pwah! How did you expect me to speak like that?! You're too close! Get outta my space!
Sumomo
Oops! Sorry!
Kanna
But why?
Kanna
How is the car working?
Sumomo
Ah, it stopped.
Kanna
...

I hear someone getting out of the driver's seat.
Sumomo
Okay, this is our chance.

A shadowy figure passes by outside the window.
Kanna
...

Hang on. I recognize that silhouette.

Keeping my body low, I peek out the window.

I see an out of service bus and a motorcycle.

There's also a semi-trailer parked in front of the bus.
Kanna
It's her!

The woman that came to see the car today.

The suspicious mechanic woman.

The one who wanted to buy Hachimaru.
Sumomo
Kanna?
Kanna
That's no kidnapper.
Kanna
She's a mechanic... No, she's just a thief. She's trying to steal Mom's car.
Sumomo
Huh? Really? She wants to steal this crappy car?
Kanna
She said it couldn't be fixed. And she said it was too old! She figured she could cheat me 'cause I don't know anything about cars!

The woman clambers into the bus, humming a song to herself.

Is this where she lives?

I reach out to my belt.

They keychain's still there.
Kanna
I'm taking it back. I'm not gonna let anyone steal my mom's car.

I remove the key from my belt.
Sumomo
Take it back?! How?!

Her voice suddenly booms into my ears.
Kanna
I'll drive it back home.
Sumomo
You?! Where's your license?!
Kanna
I don't have one.
Sumomo
Won't that end badly?!
Kanna
It's better than doing nothing and letting her steal it out from under my nose.
Sumomo
A-Are you, like, really sure about this?
Sumomo
Nooo! I don't wanna die dressed like this!

I look back out the window.

The woman's looking at Hachimaru from the bus with satisfaction written across her face.

After a while, she pulls out a cigarette, lights it up, and turns her back on us.
Kanna
Keep watch.
Sumomo
For what?!
Kanna
Her.
Sumomo
You're killing me here!

Turning my back on the panicked Sumomo, I get out of the camper and slowly stalk my way to the front of the car.

Keeping a look out for the woman, I scoot into the driver's seat.

She's still smoking in the bus.

I can see her flicking the ashes out a window.

I put the key in the ignition and turn it.
Kanna
It's working!
Azuki
Hm? ...Wha?!
Azuki
Gah! Candy! Why are yo—?!

The woman jumps out of the bus and comes barrelling straight toward me.

I release the handbrake, step on the clutch, and put the car into first gear.

When I release the clutch and step onto the accelerator, Hachimaru lurches forward.

I immediately shift into second gear.
Azuki
Hey! Dumbass! That's dangerous! Stop it right now!

She runs up to the passenger side door and opens it.

Then she reaches reaches out to grab the wheel.
Kanna
Let go! Get off!
Azuki
This ain't a damn toy!
Kanna
Fuck off!

Our two pairs of hands wildly struggle for the wheel.

Thanks to us both pulling in different directions, Hachimaru loses control.
Azuki
We're gonna freakin' crash! My bike! Aah! Let go of the fucking wheel!
Kanna
You let go! Thief!
Azuki
The breaks! Hits the breaks!

Hachimaru crashes into the motorcycle, crushing it against the side of the bus.

The loud metallic crunch sends shivers down my spine!
Azuki
Noooooooooo! My bike! You're crushing it!
Azuki
Wh-What the fuck are you doing?!
Kanna
I-I gotta reverse... Reverse!

I step on the clutch and put the car into reverse gear.
Azuki
I-It's crushed as flat as a pancake! What the hell are you doing?!
Kanna
Shut up! Let me think!

I put the car in second gear again.
Azuki
Why second again?!

Then I turn the wheel all the way to the left and step on the accelerator.
Azuki
No, no, no! You're not gonna make that turn!

She begins pulling on the wheel again.
Azuki
Hit the brakes! This ain't gonna fucking work! Listen to me!
Azuki
You're doing the same thing as before! What's the big idea?! You're not pounding mochi here, boy!
Kanna
I wanted to turn!
Azuki
With what space, eh?!
Azuki
Reverse! Fucking reverse all the way!
Azuki
Listen to me! The bike's leaking gas!
Kanna
Gas?
Azuki
Reverse if you don't wanna fucking kill us!
Kanna
Fuck!
Azuki
Reverse!

I step on the clutch, shift gears, and hit the gas!

And just as Hachimaru begins backing up...
Azuki
Fire in the hooooole!

In an instant, everything outside the windshield is covered in flames.

Caught in the blast, Hachimaru is pushed back even faster.

We speed away from the burning bus.

The bus, the bike, and the semi-trailer are all going up in flames.

Hachimaru's sudden backward momentum only stops when we hit the guardrail behind us.
Azuki
My house... My bike... My trailer...
Azuki
It's all burned down... Hahah...

The woman falls to the her knees in front of the sea of flames.
Kanna
...
Azuki
...

I stand there, staring at Hachimaru. Its engine has stopped working again.

The thief simply gazes at the smoldering remnants of the bus.
Kanna
My mom's Hachimaru...
Azuki
My bike... My house... My tools...
Azuki
And my Hachimaru...
Kanna
It's not yours!

Just then, the door at the back of the camper slowly opens.
Azuki
What are you implying here?!
Kanna
Wh-What?! Y-You're the one who stole my car!
Azuki
Yeah, and? All I did was steal it!
Kanna
Wh-What?!
Azuki
You didn't have to fuck me up like this!
Azuki
My house! My bike! And even my damn semi-trailer! They're all burned to a crisp!
Kanna
That's what you get for being a thief!
Azuki
This ain't fair at all! Fuck you!
Kanna
No, fuck you!
Sumomo
Wh-What?! What's going on?! Am I alive?! Is this heaven?!
Azuki
Damn, how many people you got back there?
Kanna
It's just us.
Sumomo
Gah!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
S-Stay away from Kanna!
Kanna
...

Sumomo jabs an accusatory finger at the thief and gets between us.
Azuki
What's with the chick?
Sumomo
Y-You tried to take hostages, didn't you? Th-The cops will get you for this!
Azuki
You what?
Sumomo
Grr!
Azuki
Who's this, Candy? Your girl?
Kanna
No!
Azuki
You two were doing it back there?
Kanna
No! Shut up!
Sumomo
Stop talking like I'm not here!
Kanna
She's my teacher. Kinda.
Azuki
H-Her?
Kanna
...

I nod.
Azuki
This bitch is a teach?
Sumomo
I CAN HEAR YOU!
Azuki
...

After heaving a huge sigh, the woman walks up to Sumomo.
Sumomo
Wh-What? Whaddya want?!

Then she walks right past her, without a glance at the trembling Sumomo, and goes straight for Hachimaru.
Sumomo
Uh...

She opens the hood and looks inside.
Azuki
Aw, crud... I just fixed the damn thing.
Kanna
...

I walk up besides her and peer down at the engine too.
Kanna
How did you fix it?
Azuki
Huh?
Kanna
How did you start it without the key?
Azuki
Trade secret.
Kanna
Tell me!
Azuki
You wouldn't understand even if I told ya. I just replaced the faulty parts and did some maintenance.
Kanna
...
Azuki
Amateur.
Kanna
What?!

Azuki takes out the same device from before and hooks it up to Hachimaru.
Azuki
Hoo boy... The electrical system's busted now.
Azuki
And I had it purring like a cat...
Kanna
Y-You said it was bad! You said it couldn't be fixed!
Azuki
There's nothing I can't fix.
Azuki
Because I'm the one and only scrap hunter extraordinaire!
Kanna
Wh-Why would you do that without permission?!
Azuki
All cars want to run free on the roads, my sweet Candy.
Kanna
...

I catch Sumomo slowly approaching Hachimaru as well.

While I can see her at the corner of my vision, I don't feel safe enough to take my eyes fully off the thief and the engine.
Kanna
It's not gonna work anymore?
Azuki
Not a chance in hell. It's not like parts for this kind of old car are just falling into my lap.
Azuki
This thing is 70 years old.
Kanna
...
Azuki
So, what are you gonna do with it?
Kanna
I'll take it back home.
Azuki
Are your ears busted too? It ain't going anywhere, kid.
Kanna
I'll push it.
Sumomo
Push?! You can push cars?
Azuki
I don't think you're gonna get too far with it on your own, Candy.
Kanna
...
Azuki
Hrm...
Azuki
Well, I guess it ain't that far.
Kanna
What? You're coming too?
Azuki
What else can I do?! I don't have a home anymore, remember?!
Azuki
That was my house you crashed into and burned down just now!
Sumomo
Huh? You mean that bus?
Azuki
Damn right.
Sumomo
Lady, are you homeless?
Azuki
I wasn't till five minutes ago!
Sumomo
...
Azuki
And I'm a scrap hunter! Not some lady!
Sumomo
Scrap hunter? What's that?

The woman sticks a cigarette into her mouth and starts clearing up some of the rubble scattered around.

We watch her for a while.
Sumomo
Hey, Kanna.
Kanna
Yeah?
Sumomo
What's a scrap hunter? What does she do?
Kanna
I dunno.

The three of us push the car along Nariyama's dark roads.

There's almost no street lights.
Sumomo
Whoa, cool! It really does move when you push it.
Azuki
Of course it does. Before they came up with engines, these were pulled by horses.
Sumomo
Huh! Makes sense.
Kanna
...

The sparsely lit road seems to stretch on forever.

At least it's flat.
Sumomo
Hey, what's your name, lady?
Azuki
Huh?
Sumomo
My name's Momonouchi Sumomo.
Azuki
Whoa, did your parents hate you or something?
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're telling me!
Azuki
You sure you're a teach, chickadee?
Sumomo
Mhm! I'm a college student doing my teacher training.
Azuki
What's that?
Sumomo
Some silly requirement to become a real teacher.
Sumomo
I actually give lessons and all.
Azuki
That so? Man, I find that hard to believe.
Sumomo
You think so too?
Azuki
I can see through that stuffy getup you got going on.
Azuki
You're not into teaching at all, are you?
Sumomo
Ahahah! Bingo!
Azuki
Well at least one of us seems to be having fun.
Sumomo
I mean, isn't it kinda funny?! We're all just a big bunch of idiots!
Azuki
Especially the guy that steps on the gas and asks questions later.
Kanna
You're the one that stole my mom's car!
Azuki
Amei Anna passed away last year, didn't she?
Kanna
Wha?
Azuki
Is it still in her name?
Kanna
You knew this whole time?
Azuki
Man, I was this close to making so much bank selling off Amei Anna's Hachimaru.
Azuki
With just a little bit of work, I would've had it running perfectly.
Azuki
To think the scrap hunter would be turned to scrap instead...
Kanna
So that's how it is, huh?

So she knew the car was my mom's and targeted it.
Sumomo
Wait a minute, you knew Kanna's mommy too?
Azuki
She was pretty well known among car enthusiasts.
Azuki
If you ride around in a beauty like this, it turns heads.
Sumomo
Kanna's mommy sure was cool, wasn't she?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Oh? Kanna?
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
Cat got your tongue?
Kanna
I don't talk to thieves. She's a criminal.
Azuki
I'd say we're in the same boat, boy. Or can you show me your driver's license?
Kanna
Don't lump me in with you!
Sumomo
Now now, kids, no fighting.
Kanna
...

We keep pushing the car, inching it forward little by little.

I'm really glad it's not a steep road.
Sumomo
So, what's your name, Miss Thief?
Azuki
I'm... You can call me Scrap Hunter Azuki.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Talk about lame!
Azuki
It's not lame! I'm gonna kill you!
Sumomo
It's totes lame! Right, Kanna?
Kanna
Yeah.
Azuki
You bitch!
Sumomo
I'm not a bitch, dummy. I'm a peach.
Azuki
Huh? Peach? Oh, 'cause of your name?
Sumomo
I'm the peachy Sumomo Momonouchi!
Azuki
Gotcha...
Azuki
Sooo you're the Bitchy Peach.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Now that's lame!
Azuki
It's not lame! Shut up! I'm gonna get you for this!
Sumomo
Pfft! What's what supposed to be? My nickname? Did you come up with it just now?
Azuki
Obviously!
Sumomo
Hah... What about Kanna? Did you give him a nickname too?
Azuki
The little squirt is Candy Boy!
Sumomo
Hahahah! Ahahahahah!
Azuki
...
Sumomo
Maaan! You're the queen of lame!
Azuki
I'm not! I'm gonna fucking kill you when we're done with this!
Sumomo
You're kinda messed up in the head, huh?
Azuki
I don't wanna hear that from you!
Kanna
You two are insane...

In the end, we push the car for over an hour before finally making it home.

When I see that the house is dark, I heave a sigh of relief.

If my dad were to see us in this situation, I don't know how I'd explain.
Sumomo
Finally!

Hachimaru is back in its rightful place in the garage.

Sumomo plops down onto the sofa.
Sumomo
That was, like, so far! I thought you said it wouldn't be that hard!
Azuki
Well, we got here in the end, didn't we?
Sumomo
I didn't think it'd take turning my arms and legs into jelly.
Sumomo
And I gotta go to the academy tomorrow. Will I even be able to wake up if I fall asleep?
Sumomo
I'll get scolded again if I'm late.

Now that I take a closer look at it under the light, I see dents all over Hachimaru's body.
Azuki
Well then.

Azuki looks my way.
Kanna
What do you want?
Azuki
Thanks to a certain someone, I'm now homeless.
Sumomo
I don't think you even had a house in the first place.
Azuki
Shut it!
Kanna
You're the one who started it!
Azuki
Just listen to me, will you, Candy?
Sumomo
Candy...

She says, holding back a chuckle.
Azuki
I also used that SR to get around.
Sumomo
SR?
Azuki
The bike.
Sumomo
Right.
Azuki
And the semi-trailer I used for work is also trashed.
Kanna
...
Azuki
It was quite a terrible tragedy you caused me, wouldn't you say?
Kanna
You're awfully mouthy for a thief.
Azuki
This garage is pretty sweet. I like it. You have tools here, and it's pretty damn comfy.
Kanna
What are you getting at?
Azuki
I'm gonna crash here for a while, capisce?
Kanna
You what?
Azuki
In exchange, I'll keep quiet about you driving without a license and trashing my stuff.
Kanna
What are you smoking?!
Azuki
If I remember right, you called me here behind your dad's back, right?
Sumomo
Whoa, really? Your daddy didn't know?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
What did you call a scrap hunter for?
Kanna
I requested her because she called herself a mobile mechanic.
Sumomo
Mooobile mechanic?
Kanna
You don't get it yet? She's a scammer. She only came here to steal the car.
Azuki
Geez, you sure like to make everything sound worse than it has to. Didn't I say I'd buy it off you?
Kanna
And I refused it, so you stole it?!
Azuki
Not quite. I just came to pick up my tools and borrowed the car to carry 'em.
Azuki
Remember how you forced me out without even letting me pick up my stuff?
Kanna
All I hear are excuses!
Azuki
I'm not cutting you a bad deal, boy. I'm not staying forever—just for the summer.
Azuki
You never know, I might even leave sooner if I find another sucker to mooch off.
Kanna
So you're basically calling me a sucker?
Sumomo
So she is.
Azuki
Anyway. I'll scram as soon as I find another place to crash.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
...
Kanna
Fine. On one condition.
Azuki
Oh?
Kanna
You said we both did wrong tonight, right? It benefits us both to keep quiet about it.
Azuki
Makes sense. So?
Kanna
Fix the car again. If you do that, you're free to stay.
Azuki
Mmh...
Kanna
...
Azuki
It kind of feels like I'm the one losing here, to be quite honest. Besides...

Azuki walks up to Hachimaru and peeks under the hood again.
Azuki
Like I told you earlier, parts for this kind of old car ain't that easy to find.
Azuki
It'll cost money, and you'll have to shoulder the cost of the parts. If you're okay with that, I can get it back to how it was.
Azuki
But even if I do that, I can't guarantee it'll work again.
Kanna
Okay. You have a deal.
Azuki
You can pay?

I nod.

I have money saved up for this.
Kanna
As long as it's not crazy money.
Azuki
Let's see...

She thinks for a while then presents me with an estimate.
Kanna
Yeah, I can pay that.
Azuki
Okay. We have a deal, then.
Sumomo
Ah.

Both of us turn to Sumomo.
Sumomo
So, I should, like, keep quiet about this too, right?
Sumomo
I gotta keep what happened today from the police, your daddy, and anyone else?
Azuki
...
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I was worried for Kanna since he isn't going to class, so I came to check on him, and then I saw a suspicious person stalking around his garage.
Azuki
...
Sumomo
And after I jumped into the car to save him, I was left alone and tossed around like a rag doll due to some people's reckless driving.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
But it'd be better if I didn't tell anyone about it...
Sumomo
Riiiight?
Azuki&Kanna
...
Azuki
Bitchy Peach, you're craftier than you look, eh?
Sumomo
You're absolutely right.

A sigh of exasperation leaves my mouth.

I can see where this is going.
Sumomo
You're coming back to the academy, right, Kanna?
Kanna
...

There it is.
Sumomo
It's just one week until the end-of-term ceremony! If don't care what you do as long as you show up to class!

She raises her right hand and declares loudly.
Kanna
...
Azuki
Go to your classes, Candy. You're a student, right?
Kanna
Not you too...
Azuki
I have a name, cretin. It's Azuki. Use it, love it.
Kanna
What's your problem?
Azuki
Go to class. And no pouting about it, Candy.
Sumomo
Yeah, what she said.
Kanna
I get it.
Sumomo
Yes! I did it! This is my turnaround! Now I can complete my teacher training!
Kanna
I'll only go this week. That's all.
Sumomo
Yeah, yeah! Whatever! I didn't go to class either back in my day.
Sumomo
Do whatever you want in the second semester.
Azuki
You're a whack teacher, you know?
Sumomo
Right? I agree!

She lets out a hearty laugh, but it stops when her gaze falls on me.
Sumomo
Say, can I ask you one more thing?
Kanna
What?
Sumomo
There's just ooone little thing that's been bugging me ever since we met.
Kanna
...

I stay silent and wait for her to continue.

Then I notice her lifting her eyes to a spot right on the top of my head.
Sumomo
Can I cut your hair?
Kanna
Excuse me?
Azuki
Let her cut it, and no pouting about it, Candy. It's not the end of the world.
Kanna
But it's the end of my hair.
Kanna
Why do you carry scissors with you?
Sumomo
Hm? For myself? I trim my own bangs.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I don't think hiding your face helps with that gloomy mood of yours. Do you like it long or something?
Kanna
I've just been too busy to cut it.
Sumomo
That's no good! Self care and fashion are important!
Sumomo
Taking care of yourself is the first step to learning to love yourself.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Can I cut it short?
Kanna
Sure, go wild.
Sumomo
Yippee! You have a really cute face, so I think you should show it off!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
I'm gonna snip snip now, okay?
Sumomo
Ta-dah!
Sumomo
All done! What do you think?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Oh? You don't like it?
Kanna
Uh, no. It isn't bad.
Sumomo
And this is how it looks at the back.

She holds a small hand mirror behind my head and shows me the nape of my neck.
Kanna
It's...
Sumomo
Hm?
Kanna
I thought it'd look weird.
Sumomo
So it looks better than you expected?

I simply nod.
Sumomo
Phew, I'm so happy to hear that! Take a look at this, Azuki!

Azuki, who's still tinkering with the car, turns our way.
Sumomo
Suits him, doesn't it? He looks like he could be in a boy band.
Azuki
Sure does. He'd be the cheeky one.
Sumomo
I know, right?! Now you're all ready for class tomorrow!
Sumomo
You might even have to fend off the girls!
Kanna
...
Sumomo
What do you say? Think you can like this new you? Not bad, is it?
Kanna
I guess...
Sumomo
Right on!
Azuki
I'll be borrowing this sofa, okay, Candy?
Kanna
Uh, sure.
Kanna
Doesn't bother me. I'm sleeping in the car.
Azuki
What? You're gonna sleep in here too?
Azuki
Don't you have a house right here?
Kanna
I'm sleeping here tonight. And that's that.
Sumomo
Things still awkward with your daddy?
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Oh, but if you're going to class tomorrow, I bet it'd help if you told him.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Okay?
Kanna
I'll tell him soon.
Azuki
Hey, Bitch. You planning on walking home?
Sumomo
Stop calling me that! If you're gonna shorten it, at last call me 'Peach' instead.
Sumomo
Besides, I'm like not bitchy at all, am I?
Azuki
I see right through that dumb disguise of yours.
Sumomo
Ugh...
Kanna
It's pretty late, you sure you'll be okay on your own?
Sumomo
I'll make it back no problem. The road is bright enough, and it's not that far from here.
Sumomo
See you tomorrow at the academy!
Sumomo
I'll be waiting for you! Okay?!
Kanna
... I get it. I'll be there.

She smiles, grabs her bag, and opens the garage door.

Her bag's so huge it doesn't match with her smart suit at all.
Sumomo
See you tomorrow!
Kanna
Yeah...
Sumomo
...

Thank goodness.

He's coming back to class.

Now I'll be able to get my teaching license.

But this is weird.

I don't feel as good as I hoped about it.

...

Thinking back on it makes me smile.

What even is a scrap hunter?

She was living some kinda vagabond life out there, huh?

And that whole 'candy boy' thing.

Not to mention 'bitchy peach.'
Sumomo
Heheh...

Her lame ideas for nicknames crack me up.

Everything was such a mess.

A buncha stuff went up in flames.

Does that kinda thing happen often? Doubt it.

Thankfully, the three of us came out of it unharmed.

It's been a long time since I laughed so much.

That woman doesn't put on airs at all.

She just lives her life, doing and saying what she wants.

And it's not the first time I've had that feeling about someone today.
Sumomo
Mm... Right.

I remember.

It was when I was looking at that picture of Kanna's mommy.

It must be nice.

Nice to be genuine like that.

Being confident in yourself and enjoying life.

Ah...

No. Stop it.

Just one more week.

If I become a real teacher, the idiots making fun of my mom will leave her alone.

No one will be able to say that she's a failure that can't educate her daughter.

I don't want her to cry because of me ever again.

I'd rather I be the one crying myself to sleep.

Still...
Sumomo
Learning to love yourself, huh?

Taking care of yourself is the first step to learning to love yourself.

Why did I even say that to him?

No...

Wrong question.

I know why.

I was saying it to myself in the mirror.
Sumomo
...

*Sigh*

I wanna shine.

I wanna dress up fancy and be the brightest star in the sky.

But...
Sumomo
Just gotta power on, for now.

With Sumomo gone, it's just Azuki and me left in the garage.
Azuki
She's pretty fun, ain't she?

Azuki has a big wide grin on her face.
Kanna
You think so?
Azuki
Yeah. She's totally cool.
Kanna
...

Azuki giggles to herself as though remembering something hilarious.
Kanna
I'm gonna go to bed.
Azuki
Sure thing.
Kanna
Don't even think about stealing from me again.
Azuki
Don't worry. This bad boy ain't gonna be moving out so easy next time.

She slaps Hachimaru's side.
Kanna
...

I get into the camper and close the door behind me.

Finally, some alone time.

The physical and mental fatigue strike me all at once.

Everything's been a huge mess ever since that Sumomo woman came along.
Kanna
...

I climb up the ladder and lie down on the bed.

A faint hint of Sumomo's scent still remains.

The memories of all those sensations that overloaded my brain come rushing back.

The feeling of something soft enveloping me.

My field of vision seems oddly clear right now.
Kanna
Oh, right.

I run a hand through my hair.

It's because she cut it.

I have way less hair now, and my head feels way lighter.
Kanna
The academy, huh?

I'll have to go into the house to get my bag and change into my uniform.

Maybe I should get them now so I can avoid...

Nah, it's too late now.

I'll just go after Dad heads out to work tomorrow.

I'll need to grab some food too.

Tomorrow. Everything can wait till tomorrow...
Kanna
...

When I close my eyes, my thoughts are immediately overtaken by a thick haze.

After shifting around a little in bed, I let myself drift away in it.
