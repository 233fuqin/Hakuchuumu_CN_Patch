...

It's day three.

Sumomo came to class again in her usual smart getup.

I find myself staring at her.

She definitely looks better when she smiles.

I'm sure she'd be way more popular if she acted like herself.

With both the boys and the girls, for sure.

Actually, maybe not the girls?

But at least she wouldn't be surrounded on all sides by people that either looked at her with disdain or actively disliked her.

The thing I really can't figure out, though...

Is why I'm so frustrated about this.

I know the usual noisy and crass Sumomo.

It's not that I particularly like her being that way, but I'm sure it's what fits her the best.

And it's the way that makes me want to snap pictures of her.

Why doesn't anyone else seem to realize?

This woman is clearly not living her best life.

Why does no one notice?

It's like no one really cares about the people around them.

What's the point of us all gathering here and being together, then?

It's so weird.

No. I guess I'm the weird one for thinking this way.
Kanna
...

Not like it matters.

Yesterday we had classes all day, but today we finish after morning lessons.

I kind of remember classes ending early on the days leading up to summer break last year.

I'm already back home by noon.

It's perfect.

If I can finish pinpointing the possible campsites before the semester ends, I'll be able to hit the library and do my research as soon as summer break starts.

I'll finish up either today tomorrow, or the day after that at the latest.

I can feel things looking up a little now.
Azuki
Nhah... Oh, Candy? It's morning? *Yawn*
Kanna
Noon, actually.
Azuki
Oh, that so? *Yawn*

Azuki yawns and stretches out, which causes interesting things to happen to her voluptuous curves.
Kanna
How many times do I need to tell you to wear clothes?
Azuki
Oh, sorry ‘bout that. Slipped my mind.
Kanna
What are you working on today? Can I be in the car?
Azuki
Hm? Sure. You gonna be up to something in there again?
Kanna
Yeah.
Azuki
Go right ahead. The part we need ain't here yet.
Kanna
I can help you with the repairs if you want.
Azuki
Nah. There's not much I can do till the starter arrives.
Kanna
I'm kinda curious about something you said before. You know, the whole thing about what to do if it doesn't work even with the new starter.
Azuki
Uh-huh?
Kanna
So if that happens, what do we do?
Azuki
Well...
Kanna
...
Azuki
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, as they say.
Kanna
...
Azuki
Pray, Candy.
Kanna
I'm not a fan of that saying.
Azuki
We'll figure something out! 'Sides, there's more Hachimarus out there.
Kanna
No!

Azuki's clearly surprised by my fervent rebuttal.
Kanna
It has to be this car.
Azuki
Then you better get praying, my sweet boy.
Kanna
...
Kanna
That's Lake Kawaguchi...
Kanna
Hahah, that's where Mom fell out of the canoe.
Kanna
It was winter, and she was shivering all day after that.

I remember Mom laughing her ass off while dripping with water.

I remember it well.

I took this picture.
Kanna
We had so much fun there...

I write down Lake Kawaguchi as a possible location as I reminiscence about our time there.

Looking back on things, we really visited a lot of places together.

There are also pictures from when we went to see the first sunrise of the new year at Omaezaki beach.

And pictures of us on the observation deck at Cape Shioya.

I think we camped nearby and explored the area by car.

Most of the photos in the albums are of me, taken by Mom.

If I knew what would happen...

If only I knew she'd be gone so soon, I would have picked up a camera earlier and taken even more pictures of her.
Kanna
...

I feel the tears coming.

Shaking my head to drive them away, I reach out for the next album.

When I've been through more albums than I have left to look at, I step back out into the garage.
Sumomo
Ah! Howdy!
Kanna
...

Sumomo's here.

She's still in her work clothes.
Kanna
Where's Azuki?
Sumomo
Smoking outside. You got her to stop doing it inside?
Kanna
There's lots of stuff that can catch fire in here.
Sumomo
Ahahah! We've had enough fire to last us a lifetime, huh?
Kanna
I'd rather she not burn us to a crisp.

I walk past Sumomo and go to the sink.
Sumomo
So you were in the car, huh? I didn't realize.
Kanna
Really?
Sumomo
Yeppers.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Uh, are you angry?
Kanna
Why do you say that?
Sumomo
You seem kinda grumpy. What's up? Shouldn't I have come in without permission?
Kanna
It's a bit late for that now.
Sumomo
Hahah! Good point.
Kanna
...
Kanna
Why are you dressed like that?
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
You don't need to be in work mode when you're here.
Sumomo
I do! Otherwise I'm gonna get carried away.
Sumomo
You just happened to find me like that yesterday.
Sumomo
If I don't dress like this, I'll forget we're supposed to be teacher and student.
Sumomo
I'm dumb, you know.
Kanna
Who cares? Just do you.
Kanna
You're here to hang out, not to teach me anything.
Sumomo
Nooo, I can't!
Sumomo
But thanks.
Kanna
Don't you hate it though?
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
You're way prettier when you dress up the way you like.
Kanna
I'm sure all your students think you're some kind of country bumpkin.
Sumomo
Ahahah. So I'm not a peach anymore, huh? Sumomo Bumpkin is is, then!
Kanna
Don't you hate that?
Sumomo
Not at all?
Kanna
Why not?!

Even I'm surprised by my raised tone.

But Sumomo seems not to care as she puts a finger to her lips and thinks.
Sumomo
Mmh... Guess I got used to it? I guess I kinda just don't care what people say about me.
Sumomo
I mean, I don't really care about the opinion of anyone in that class.
Sumomo
That's not really the part I hate about dressing like this.
Kanna
Huh?
Sumomo
You know how people like your mom and our Scrap Hunter live freely, dressing how they like and doing whatever they want?
Kanna
I guess?

Azuki certainly doesn't care when I tell her to put on clothes.
Sumomo
What I hate is wanting to live like that and not being able to right now. Hmm. It's like I'm feeling kinda lonely where I am?
Sumomo
Me feeling unhappy doesn't have to do much with what others say or think about me. I'm kind of self-sufficient like that.
Kanna
You're weird.

She smiles upon hearing that.
Sumomo
I've had a weird life.
Azuki
Oh, Peach! You didn't bring anything tasty today?
Sumomo
I brought cup noodles, actually.
Azuki
Where's the booze, woman?!
Sumomo
You're a terrible drunk.
Azuki
Me?! No way.
Kanna
Hmm?
Kanna
You don't remember?
Azuki
What's there to remember?

Azuki stops and looks at me.
Kanna
Wha?
Sumomo
It happens, yep.
Kanna
You pushed me down onto the sofa and vomited all over me!
Sumomo
It happens, yep.
Azuki
Me? Don't be silly.

Azuki shakes her head and returns to her work.
Azuki
I've never been drunk.
Kanna
You gotta be kidding me.
Sumomo
That's what they always say. It happens, oh it does.
Azuki
What're you doing here anyway, Peach?
Sumomo
I kind of finished work already, so I don't have much to do.
Sumomo
Now that I don't have to prepare lessons anymore, I feel like a ton got lifted off my shoulders.
Azuki
What do you even teach?
Sumomo
World History.
Azuki
Hahah! You?! Get outta here!
Sumomo
Hey, Azuki, know what republicanism is?
Azuki
What?
Sumomo
Republicanism. Think you can spell it?
Azuki
No way in hell, dude.
Sumomo
Hahah! I knew it!
Kanna
You staying, Sumomo? I'll go back to the car.
Sumomo
Huh? In there? But why? What're you doing in there?
Kanna
There's something I gotta do.
Sumomo
What is it? I wanna see!
Azuki
Peach.

Azuki turns to Sumomo and shakes her head.
Azuki
Do you need to ask? We're dealing with a guy here. He's going to spank the monkey.
Sumomo
Oh, right. He's gonna make the baldie cry, huh?
Kanna
No! I don't do that in there!
Azuki
Yeah, whatever you say. That's our good boy.
Kanna
You think I've been, err, doing you-know-what in there since last night?!
Azuki
Yeah. What else is there to do in there?
Kanna
Tons of stuff!
Sumomo
Come on, don't hold out on us! What're you doing?!
Azuki
He's greasing the pipe, that's what he's doing!
Kanna
No I'm not! And it's a secret!
Sumomo
Ahahah! What a cutie!
Kanna
Shut up!
Kanna
...

I go into the camper and close the door.

I can still hear them joking around.

With one ear on their boisterous chatter, I open the next album and continue listing out campsites.

After a while, the voices outside Hachimaru cease.

Maybe Sumomo went home.

I get up and stretch.

I'm making good progress.

But I'm already yawning and my eyes are getting teary.

Rubbing them to stay awake, I turn to the next page.
Kanna
Ah...

I find another photo of Mom smiling.

And Dad's next to her.

Which means...

...I took this photo too.

She looks really happy.

It reminds of Sumomo's smile from yesterday.

Mom and Azuki.

Sumomo said they dressed and lived how they wanted.
Kanna
...

What I hate is wanting to live like that and not being able to...

Her words come back to me, then disappear.

I look to my side.

Mom's printer is still there.
Kanna
...
Kanna
Oof!

I lift up the printer in both arms.

It's heavy so heavy I can barely carry it on my own.

Using my foot, I open the back door.

Then stick my head out.

Azuki's already asleep on the sofa.

Moving carefully, I get out of the car and connect the printer to an outlet.

When I press the on button, a green light comes up, and I hear some internal part of the machine whirr into life.

I insert my camera's memory stick directly into the printer.

Yesterday's photos come up on the little LCD display.

Pressing the button, I move through the slideshow.
Kanna
...

I choose the photo and press print.

A loud noise comes from the printer.

For a moment, I worry about waking Azuki, but then I realize that the sound of her snoring is equally loud.

It's unlikely that anything could wake that woman.
Kanna
...

Sumomo's smile is very much like my mom's.

I truly think so.

I feel like it perfectly encapsulates what Sumomo meant when she talked about being who she wanted to be.

I really like this picture.

I'm sure Sumomo will like it too.

Of that, I'm confident.
Kanna
...

I'll give this photo to her tomorrow.

I look over my shoulder at the sofa.

Azuki's now snoring at full force.
Kanna
I told her to turn off the lights before going to bed.

I switch off the garage lights then climb back up into Hachimaru, taking the printer with me.
