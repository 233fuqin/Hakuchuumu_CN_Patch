Yonagi
I want to read a book.
Kaito
A book?
Yonagi
Yes.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
Like a picture book?

Yonagi shakes her head.
Yonagi
...A novel.
Kaito
Oh, okay.
Kaito
Are there any in the recreation room? I saw a bunch of picture books.
Izumo
No. There are no novels.
Kaito
Where can we get some?
Izumo
There may be some in the facility's library. I will fetch some.
Kaito
Would you like her to do that?

Yonagi nods.
Izumo
I need an author and title.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
I guess...
Kaito
Rashomon, by Ryunosuke Akutagawa.

Izumo doesn't bring us one of the slim pocket books that appeared in my dreams.

Instead, she returns with a complete compilation of Ryunosuke Akutagawa's works, one of which is Rashomon.

The book is as heavy as a portable computer.

Yonagi opens it on her lap and reads slowly.
Kaito
...

I watch Yonagi as she reads.

Her gaze silently glides over the sea of small letters printed across the pages of the large book.
Kaito
You like books?
Yonagi
Yes. I like them.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito
Want me to stop talking?
Yonagi
It's okay.
Yonagi
I like talking with you too.

Yonagi doesn't take her eyes off the thick tome as she speaks.
Kaito
It looks like a difficult book. You can read it?
Yonagi
Yeah, kind of.
Yonagi
It's fun to just go word by word.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
Wanna read together?
Kaito
Really?

Yonagi nods and raises her face.
Yonagi
It's okay.
Kaito
...

I sit next to her and follow the sentences together with her.

The paper has a yellow tint to it, and the text is dotted with characters I don't recognize.

It's immediately apparent that this is a really old book.

I take a glance at her profile.

She's zealously going word by word, even if she doesn't understand them all.
Kaito
...

I follow her example and let my eyes take in the words weaved by a man named Ryunosuke Akutagawa.
Yonagi
...I'm hungry.
Kaito
Do you wanna go eat something?

She nods.
Kaito
Okay, let's go with Izumo.
