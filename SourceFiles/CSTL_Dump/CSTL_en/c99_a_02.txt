Yonagi
I want to see a play.
Kaito
A theater play?
Shleep
*Chirp*

I turn to Izumo.
Kaito
I'm not expecting a positive answer, but I gotta ask—
Izumo
You can watch videos from the archive.
Kaito
Videos, huh? Okay.

I look back at Yonagi.
Kaito
Does that sound good to you?
Yonagi
Yes.
Kaito
Well, you heard her.
Izumo
There are some tablets you can use in the recreation room. Come this way.
Izumo
What play do you want to see?
Yonagi
Play...
Kaito
Hmm...
Kaito
A Midsummer's Night's Dream. From Shakespeare.
Izumo
Understood.
Yonagi
...

Izumo hands us a tablet device, and its screen displays people wearing clothes I've never seen before acting out a play.

Maybe my memory is just busted. Maybe the people of this city wear stuff like this.

No, just from looking at Izumo's attire and this whole facility's design, I can tell that this video was recorded in a completely different time period.
Yonagi
This actor is good. That actor is bad.
Kaito
You can tell? I think they're speaking in French or something.

Yonagi nods in response.
Yonagi
Kind of.
Kaito
...

I remember Olivia's demanding standards from the dream.
Yonagi
This actor is trying too hard. This one isn't trying at all.
Kaito
Whoa, you have no mercy.
Yonagi
I want to act in a play.
Kaito
You like plays?
Yonagi
Yeah, I like them.
Yonagi
I like being someone I'm not.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
But the times I can be myself are more precious.
Kaito
Huh?

I think on her words for a moment.

The times she can be herself?
Yonagi
Heheh, it's Puck. The troublemaker one.

She happily mutters to herself.

I peer down at the screen in her hands.
Kaito
That's a really cute boy.
Yonagi
Mhm.

The closing of the curtain signals a scene change.

Eventually, the pair of men and women wander into the forest and start arguing with each other.
Yonagi
In this play...
Yonagi
A woman's acting in it.
Kaito
Oh, you're right.
Yonagi
...I'm glad.
Yonagi
The world did change. I'm happy.

Yonagi has a sweet smile on her face as she watches.

After looking at her placid expression for a moment, I turn to watch the play together with her.
Yonagi
I'm hungry.

She mutters, in the middle of third act.
Kaito
Want to go eat?
Yonagi
Yes.

She bobs her head.

I raise my face and look at Izumo.

She nods in response and quickly heads out of the recreation room.
Kaito
Let's go.
