...

So we're finally having the last dream.

I rise from bed.
Yonagi
Kaito. Good morning.
Kaito
Good morning.
Yonagi
Did you have a dream?
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
...Right.

She smiles softly.

Izumo and Wooleep come into the room.

This time, they stop in the doorway and look at me.

Izumo nods at me almost imperceptibly.

I suppose that means I can proceed as I wish.
Kaito
Wanna go play?
Yonagi
Play?
Kaito
You wanna do something, right?

I ask, knowing what her answer will be.
