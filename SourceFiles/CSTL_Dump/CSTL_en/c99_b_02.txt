After eating the porridge made for us by Izumo, Yonagi and I head to the recreation room.
Yonagi
Kaito, sit there.
Kaito
Here?
Yonagi
Yes, you are the customer.
Kaito
Oh, okay.
Yonagi
Welcome! Welcome!
Kaito
Hm? Isn't this supposed to be a play?
Yonagi
We have alcohol, and we also have food if you want.
Kaito
Oh, so you're the owner.
Yonagi
What would you like to drink?
Kaito
One cup of water, please.
Yonagi
The water here is bad, though.
Kaito
I see.

The same as the dream, then.
Kaito
Then I'll have a cup of ale.
Yonagi
Coming right up.

Yonagi pulls a cylindrical object out of the toybox.
Yonagi
Glug glug glug.
Kaito
Ah, you're serving the ale?
Yonagi
Yes, it's done. Here you go.
Kaito
Thank you very much. Glug glug...
Yonagi
Don't drink it yet!
Kaito
Oh, okay?
Yonagi
You look like a horse stepped on your face today.
Kaito
What?!
Yonagi
You want to tell me about your bad day, right?
Kaito
Not really, no...
Yonagi
Come on, out with it. It'll help you feel better.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
You got problems, right?!
Kaito
Uh...

Problems, huh?
Kaito
Um, well, I kind of can't remember who I am or where I am.
Yonagi
Ah, so you've lost yourself.
Kaito
I suppose that's one way to put it, yeah.
Yonagi
All you can do in moments like this is drink.
Kaito
R-Really?
Yonagi
Drink up!
Kaito
Oh, I can drink now?

She bobs her head.
Kaito
Glug glug.
Yonagi
Whoa, you drink like a fish. Here, have another.
Kaito
Thank you very much.

We repeat the same exchange until I finish "drinking" my eighth cup of ale.

After being told I've lost sight of myself eight times in a row, I feel like it's actually happening.
