Arishima
...

I lean back against the wall of the smoking room and close my eyes.

I slowly take a drag of my cigarette and exhale.

I'm tired.

My eyelids feel heavy.

It's been two weeks since I started writing.

I completed the first draft this morning.

In the end, it took twice as long as I expected.

Yesterday, I wrote through the night.

I was gonna take a nap, but by the time I finished it was already time to leave for work.

I haven't slept well these last few weeks.

But I finished the first draft.

It's been years since I focused on writing like this.

As I lean there, the door opens and someone comes in.

I struggle to open my eyes and look toward the entrance.
Watanabe
...
Arishima
Hey.
Watanabe
...
Arishima
...

With his hand still on the sliding door, Watanabe stares at me.
Arishima
What is it?
Watanabe
Mind if I come in?
Arishima
Sure?

Watanabe sits next to me, pulls a packet of cigs out of his pocket, and pops one into his mouth.
Arishima
Whoa, you bought your own?
Watanabe
I always have them on me, actually.

Instead of making a snappy comeback, I simply exhale a lungful of smoke.
Watanabe
It's kind of hard to approach you these days.
Watanabe
Didn't even know if I should ask for a cig like I always do.

The comment makes me laugh out loud.
Watanabe
What's so funny?
Arishima
Nothing. It's just kinda funny to see you being so thoughtful.
Watanabe
I'll have you know guys like me are awfully sensitive, you know?
Arishima
I'm well aware, don't worry.
Watanabe
Then gimme one.

Chuckling, I hold out a cig for him.

He takes it, lights it, and looks a little more at ease by the time he huffs out the first puff of smoke.
Arishima
...I was writing a novel.

He looks up at me, eyes wide open in surprise.
Watanabe
A novel? Ah, right.
Arishima
Every day for the last two weeks.
Watanabe
Oh, so that's what you've been up to.

I nod.
Watanabe
And that's why you've been going around looking as grave as a tomb.
Arishima
Apparently.
Watanabe
I'm serious, man. You've had your head in the clouds for the last two weeks.
Arishima
I finished the first draft.

Watanabe stares at me curiously.
Watanabe
Well, that's good.
Arishima
That doesn't mean it's complete yet.
Watanabe
That's not what I meant.

I turn to him again.
Watanabe
You felt like writing again, right?
Watanabe
You oughta do what you love.

I regard him in silence.
Watanabe
I mean, you love books, right?
Arishima
Yeah, I do.
Arishima
I do love them.
Watanabe
So what are you gonna do with this novel? Aren't there like, contests for that kind of stuff? To get published and all that.
Arishima
Rookie awards, yeah. There's plenty of those.
Watanabe
You wanna get it out there?
Arishima
Nah.
Arishima
It's not that kind of novel.
Arishima
I think the act of writing is meaningful in and of itself. Know what I mean?
Watanabe
Hmm...

Smoke wafts from both our hands.
Watanabe
So you won't let anyone read it? Kind of a shame after you've spent so much time and effort writing it.
Watanabe
...What about your wife?
Arishima
...I wonder about that.

I stare vacantly at the rising smoke.

Rin's face comes to mind, as does my wife's.

Not as she looks right now, but how she looked back when we first met.

Classes are done for the day.

I go to the library for the first time in a good while.

I haven't talked to Rin since Watanabe words of caution.

Lately, the only space we've shared is the classroom.

I find her sitting at a table by the window reading a book.

She raises her face from it.

When she notices me, she directs a little smile at my way.
Rin
It's been a while.

I nod.

She closes her book, the smile still on her face.

I sit down opposite her.
Arishima
Another one of your dad's books?

She shakes her head.

She shows me the cover of the book.
Arishima
Naoya Shiga?

She nods.
Rin
That writer you said you like.
Arishima
...

Didn't that conversation happen in a dream...?
Rin
You told me when you showed me that old album.
Arishima
O-Oh, right. Yeah.

So I did tell her about it in real life.
Rin
I've been wanting to talk with you this whole time, but you never showed up.

I notice several other books by the same author next to her.
Rin
How have you been?
Arishima
I came to talk to you.
Rin
...
Arishima
Was this occupied?
Rin
It's fine. Go ahead.

She sets her book aside and neatly places her hands on her lap.
Arishima
...You said you want to read what I write.
Rin
Yes.

She answers with a nod.
Arishima
...I wrote something.
Rin
...
Arishima
Would you read it?
Rin
Yes.
Arishima
I'd like you to read it and tell me...

She tilts her head curiously and waits for me to continue.
Arishima
If Hatano Shuho and I... are at all similar.
Arishima
And if we are, I'd like to know in what way.
Arishima
I want to hear it from you.
Arishima
That's why I wrote it.
Arishima
I wrote about Hatano Shuho.

Rin squints at me for a moment.
Rin
Whether you and my dad are alike?

I stare at her in silence as she mutters the words to herself.
Arishima
I wrote the story about the ginkgo.

Upon hearing this, she nods.
Rin
Ah...

Then she nods again and smiles.
Rin
So it was you.
Arishima
You already realized?
Rin
No.

She quirks a smile and puts a finger to her lower lip, deep in thought.
Rin
I see.
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
You already wrote what you want to show me, right?

I nod.
Arishima
I finished the first draft this morning.

She nods back.
Arishima
I'll revise it a little more.
Arishima
Then I'd like for you to give it a read through.

She stares silently into my eyes.

After a moment, she speaks up again.
Rin
When can I read it?

I think for a moment.

It's not a particularly long piece.

Today is Friday.

I can do some minimal tweaking to it over the weekend.

Even if I had more time, I can't just keep fixing stuff endlessly. It's important to let go.
Arishima
I'll bring it first thing next week.
Rin
I'll be waiting.
Arishima
Thank you.
Rin
No, thank you.

I stand up.
Rin
You're going home already?
Arishima
I didn't sleep at all last night.
Arishima
My body's passing on the bill already. Time to pay with some sleep.

She rewards my silly comment with a little giggle.
Rin
Rest well.
Arishima
I'll try.
Arishima
See you next week.
Rin
Yes.
Rin
I'm happy we got to talk again.
Rin
Bye.

I nod a farewell to her.

Just standing up makes my stomach feel like a piece of lead.

My body feels really close to giving out. My legs seem to be made of jelly.

I don't feel drowsy, but the fatigue is really piling on.

I turn on my laptop and open my manuscript file.

The printer purrs as I print out the draft I finished this morning.

After checking the first few pages to make sure there are no printing errors, I lay down on the bed.

I cover my eyes with my arm and sigh.

Then I take several slow, deep breaths.

With each exhale, my consciousness slowly drifts.

When I awake, the room is dark and the papers are all piled on the printer tray.

I pick them up and head to my desk.

Then I take a red pen from the pen holder.

I begin reading from the first sentence.

I use the red pen to delineate adjustments to the structure, wording, and punctuation.

I love editing.

It's much easier than writing, and I can better grasp the shape and texture of my words.

This is the image of Shuho the idol that I have inside my mind.

His outline is becoming clearer.

I continue from the prologue where he takes his first step as a professional writer, and progress into his life.

It's rife with change.

The protagonist is making a name for himself in the world of literature.

After winning his Rookie Award, he pumps out hit after hit, and receives the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for his third release.

He marries.

He sells his first million copies.

He gets his first film adaptation.

His media exposure increases exponentially.

As his life changed rapidly, he was pulled, molded, and made to grow by it.

From rags to riches. A tale as old as time.

Despite having written this myself, I must say that I find Shuho's story to be a real page-turner. It's like it's pulling me in.

I had no idea about his private life. Not really.

I was able to write about it once I dipped into the territory of fiction.

Reading this over, I realize once more.

The path Shuho followed was the ideal I wanted for myself once upon a time.

That desire for approval and recognition that I lost.

The withered desire to be in the spotlight.

Once upon a time, I had the same aspirations as him.

But I gave up, whereas he kept up the fight.

He fulfilled all of those young desires.

I wanted to live like he did.

I wanted the constant whirl of interactions and experiences he had. A life where you could see and do it all.

What did he see at the end?

What thoughts crossed his mind at the edge of death?

I can't imagine he had zero regrets.

I'm not young or gullible enough to take the persona he put up for the public at face value.

I had a list of the events of his life, and the impressions he left on his own flesh and blood, Rin.

I used those to piece together a picture of him and held it close to my heart.

In my own way, I depicted the inner world of a person who became an idol and was elevated to prominence.

A state of mind only those who fulfill their desires arrive at.

I'm sure a lot of people would be interested in this.

Here, I gave Shuho a human touch.

I depicted the frustrating experience of a divorce.

A latent distrust of women.

The existence of a daughter named Rin.

Despite his love for her, he dies without ever really knowing how to connect with his daughter.

And what he saw at the brink of life and death was...

The lost time with his family.

It takes me until midnight to finish the first round of corrections.

Now I have to actually apply the changes and print again.

I gather all the draft pages and place them in front of the laptop.

Over 100 sheets of A4 paper.

Some pages are a sea of bright red.

I have a lot of corrections to make.

The first draft is really not in a state to be shown to anyone just yet.

At this point, I still haven't managed to get the image in my mind fully out onto the paper.

Hopefully by the second draft I'll have the composition and writing that can convey what I'm trying to tell to the reader.

At least something good enough to get an impression of the structure from a third party.

Writing a first draft is like holding your breath underwater.

The second is a little easier to push out.

My concentration is a little off, but work goes apace.

When I've implemented about half the corrections, I take a break.

I still have Saturday and Sunday to get this done.

Then I can hand over the manuscript to Rin first thing Monday like I promised.

I raise my face from the screen and stretch my neck.

My bones make a satisfying popping noise.

My mind feels awfully clear. Maybe all the time spent awake in the dead of the night is affecting me.

My internal clock is getting messed up.

After our recent incident, my wife seems to feel even more awkward around me, so she's at home even less than before.

And it won't get any better. We're like two complete strangers at this point.

Still, right now it suits me to be alone in the house most of the time.

I decide to make myself a cup of coffee and keep working at it a while longer in the living room.
