Will
Mm...
Olivia
Why so pensive? Writing a new piece?
Will
Yeah, it's a new piece all right, but...
Olivia
You're stuck? I'll read it for you. What kind of story is it?
Will
Actually...

I place the object of my dismay on the counter.

Olivia immediately regards it with suspicion.
Olivia
Huh? What's this? It stinks.
Will
It's supposed to be pottage stew.
Olivia
Pottage? Ah, I see. I thought you drank too much and barfed into the bowl or something of the like.
Will
Did you just call my food vomit?
Olivia
I think you underestimate the way it stinks... *Sniff* What in name of the Lord did you put in this... this thing...
Will
Potatoes.
Olivia
Okay... Well, that sounds very standard. Why does it smell so bloody sour, though?
Will
Try it out and you'll see.
Olivia
You want me to put that sour, stinking regurgitation in my mouth? Am I hearing this right?

I nod, trying to block out the way she keeps likening my food to vomit.
Will
Believe in me, my love.
Olivia
...You didn't put anything weird in this, did you?
Will
It's an experiment for a new menu item. I wouldn't put anything strange in it.

With obvious trepidation, Olivia picks up a spoon as she looks down at the bowl the same way one would look at a heap of trash.
Olivia
...

She takes a spoonful and raises it to her mouth.
Will
How is it?
Olivia
As sour as I imagined.
Will
Doesn't it have a refreshing aftertaste?
Olivia
Not at all.
Will
Hmm...
Olivia
I wasn't even aware that pottage soup was, well, a thing in the first place. What did you put in this?
Will
The main ingredients are potatoes and milk, right? Then I added salt and pepper.
Olivia
Uh, did you make sure the milk wasn't bad? Why would it be this acidic?
Will
I put in some vinegar to give it a special kick.
Olivia
Excuse moi?
Will
Okay, hear me out. So our customers come to drink, right? It's obviously bad for their liver, but I heard that vinegar is really good for that, so I thought we could...
Olivia
I don't want to hear you spilling the beans on vinegar!
Will
How rude, vinegar isn't even made out of beans.
Olivia
Oh, shut up. Don't even dare.
Will
...

Olivia frowns and rubs at the spot between her eyebrows in clear displeasure.
Olivia
This is the literal opposite of a secret ingredient. You completely eliminated the taste of the potatoes with it.
Olivia
It just tastes like taking a swig of the vinegar bottle.
Will
Oh, good!
Olivia
Excuse moi?!
Will
I hear that people in the Orient drink vinegar to stay healthy.
Olivia
So what?!
Will
You look a little healthier already.
Olivia
We're talking about a new menu item, right?! Where's all this vinegar bollocks coming from?! You're just full of beans!
Will
What's with you and beans today? Anyway, it's not bollocks, vinegar is—
Olivia
Silence! We didn't even have vinegar in stock! Where did you get it?!
Will
I bought some, see?

I pull an unopened bottle of vinegar from under the counter and place it in front of her.

I was told that it's vinegar made from the same ingredients as wine.
Olivia
Wine vinegar, okay. It is true that it's good for the body, and it could enhance the flavor of a pottage.
Olivia
But don't tell me you put two or three spoonfuls of this in the pot, please. The flavor is too overpowering to add more than a few drops.
Will
I put in the whole thing to see what happened.
Olivia
What?! The whole bottle?!
Will
Mhm.
Olivia
That's not a secret ingredient! You pickled those poor potatoes! Where did you learn to cook?!
Will
You know I'm self-taught. No one taught me how to write or how to cook.
Will
Since I'm kind of making the theater thing work out, I imagined I could do the same with cooking.
Olivia
Well, that's a bloody shame. I see that your talent doesn't go beyond the theather's walls.
Will
But I—
Olivia
No buts! Anyone with even one lick of cooking aptitude wouldn't spill a whole bottle of vinegar in a bloody soup! This is basic common sense!
Will
Are you sure simply deviating from the norm is such a bad thing?
Olivia
Do you need to ask?! You used a whole bottle of vinegar!
Will
But...
Olivia
No bloody buts!

Olivia blows out a sigh of exasperation.
Olivia
Get out of the way. If you want a new dish that badly, I'll make it. You just go back to the desk and keep writing. I hereby banish you from the kitchen.
Will
O-Okay...
Olivia
Why did you even choose vinegar? Of all the things to get, I swear on the Lord's bones...
Will
I heard the other pubs are selling pickled beans, and they're pretty popular, so I thought it'd be a hit with our patrons.
Will
Apparently they improve the metabolism and cure constipation.
Olivia
...So this really was about beans all along, huh?
Will
Hahah! Now that you mention it, yeah!
Olivia
Enough laughter! You really tick me off!
