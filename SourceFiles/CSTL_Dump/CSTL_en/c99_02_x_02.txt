Yonagi
I'm sleepy.
Kaito
Oh.
Yonagi
...
Izumo
Hello there.
Kaito
Ah, good thing you're here. Yonagi's—
Izumo
Yes, It's okay. She can sleep here.
Shleep
*Chirp*

Izumo quickly grabs a blanket from a nearby rack and covers Yonagi with it.
Izumo
...

Izumo stares at Yonagi.

I follow her gaze and look at Yonagi's sleeping face as well.

The corners of her mouth are curled into a placid smile.
Kaito
She's smiling?
Izumo
Yes.

Izumo keeps staring at her face as she gently strokes her head.
Kaito
...
Izumo
You can go to sleep whenever you want.
Kaito
Oh, okay.

Now that she mentions it, I'm quite drowsy.
Kaito
I'm a bit sleepy, yeah. I'll go back to my bed.
Izumo
Yes.

I turn my back on Yonagi, Izumo, and Wooleep.
Kaito
...

As I'm about to go out the door, I look back at the recreation room.
Kaito
Izumo.
Izumo
Yes?
Kaito
Good night.
Izumo
...

I get the feeling that my comment perplexes her, somehow.

Turning back to the corridor, I leave the room.
Izumo
Ah... Good night.

I hear her faint response from behind the now closed door.

I walk back to my room feeling strangely calm.

I have no idea what this experiment is for.

But maybe it isn't such a bad idea to cooperate.

Such are the thoughts that cross my mind as I yawn on my way back to bed.
