Yonagi
I want to take pictures.
Kaito
Pictures?

Yonagi nods.
Yonagi
Can we?
Kaito
Well, we'd need a camera.
Izumo
There is one ready for use in the recreation room. It can take pictures.
Kaito
Oh, okay.

I turn from Izumo back to Yonagi.
Kaito
Wanna go somewhere to take the pictures?

Yonagi nods.
Yonagi
Thanks.
Kaito
So, where should we go?
Yonagi
...Outside. That'd be nice.
Kaito
Hmm, the only place where we can go outside would be...
Kaito
The rooftop.

Izumo nods.
Kaito
Okay, let's try it out.
Yonagi
Okay.
Yonagi
Whoa.

Clasping the small digital camera, Yonagi rushes out onto the rooftop.
Yonagi
Kaito, it's really pretty.

Yonagi points the camera at the round sky dome and presses the shutter.

She smiles proudly as she looks at the result displayed on the small screen.
Yonagi
It's a round sky.
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
Ah...

She then points the camera at me and presses the button.

Then she shows me the picture on the camera's display.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
Ah!

She excitedly points the camera at Izumo next.

And right after that, she does the same for Wooleep.
Yonagi
Izumo. Wooleep.
Kaito
Yeah.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Yonagi
Take some of me.

She presents me with the camera.
Kaito
Are you sure?

She nods enthusiastically.

Yonagi walks closer to the handrail and strikes a pose with a hand on her waist.
Kaito
Okay, I'm taking it now.
Yonagi
Am I cute?
Kaito
Really cute.
Yonagi
Yay!
Yonagi
Show me, show me!

Yonagi rushes over to me.

I hold out the camera to her.
Yonagi
You're pretty good.
Kaito
Thanks.
Yonagi
But you still have a long way to go.
Kaito
Excuse me?
Yonagi
It's fine, don't worry. Take more, please?
Kaito
Sure.

After that, we keep taking pictures. The day goes by with literally all the pictures of Izumo featuring the same deadpan expression.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Huh? What's wrong?
Yonagi
I'm hungry.
Izumo
Shall we go eat?

Yonagi nods.
Kaito
Let's go back inside.
Izumo
Yes.
