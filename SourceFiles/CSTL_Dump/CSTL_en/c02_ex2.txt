After becoming the Lord Chamberlain's Men, we released three more plays.

Today's the premiere of the latest of them.

It takes me back to the play we performed in secret for Queen Elizabeth, Romeo and Juliet.

That's the play that got us the position of Lord Chamberlain's Men in the first place.

I wrote only tragedies for a while after that, so this time I wrote a comedy.

After the play, I go out and greet our expectant audience, and the theater breaks out in an ovation.

A play is complete only when it finally elicits a reaction from the audience.

Their cheers fill the theater, guiding our production, and giving the actors on stage confidence.

Thus the performance improves, and the audience grows more and more engrossed in our stories.

What kickstarts that cycle is the script at the base of it all.

There are times when a good script can make up for a lacking execution and performance, but there's no such thing as a good play without a good script.

Once there is a script, it is the job of the playwright to keep the whole troupe within the bounds of the story.

I've done this professionally for a while now, but premieres are one thing I'll never get used to.

I head back to the wing of the stage, the full seats of the theater causing me to smile from ear to ear.
Olivia
Good job out there.
Will
Thanks.
Olivia
Now you're conducting yourself like the great man you are. It's the least I expect from Tenbridge's best-selling author.
Will
Take another look. My knees are jelly.

Olivia glance at my shivering knees.
Olivia
Oh, you weren't joking.
Will
Premieres always make me nervous.

She looks back at me and gives me a reassuring smile.
Olivia
I think it's a fine thing. Never forget that humility.
Kiki
Hey, Will! Leader!
Olivia
Mm?
Will
Yes?

Strictly speaking, she's not the troupe leader anymore.

But that's what everyone in the troupe still calls her.

I always consult with her about my latest works, and we also plan out the production together.

And she's in charge of the rehearsals and the logistics of it all.

She's also the one who whips us all into shape.

While she may not be on the stage anymore, she is still the leader of this troupe behind the curtains.

It is not what we desired, but for now she's content being our shadow leader.
Kiki
Some big wig from the castle wants to speak with us, supposedly.
Will
Oh, really?
Kiki
Mhm.
Olivia
Are you sure it's not just a fan trying to get our attention?
Kiki
A person of great importance, they said.
Olivia
No one who is actually of great importance would ever refer to themselves as such. How suspicious.
Kiki
I thought the same, but they just won't go away. They said my whole family would be beheaded unless I bring the people in charge to them.
Olivia
They can do that?
Will
You're working backstage, Olivia. The only ones they have to see are me and Kiki.
Kiki
Uh, they kind of asked for the leader, specifically.
Will
For Olivia, you mean?

We exchange slightly alarmed glances.

Olivia is no longer working here in any official capacity, so if they requested her by name...

It might be someone we know.
Will
Wanna go see what this is all about?
Olivia
Yes. Let's go see who they are. Perhaps they are as important as they claim, after all.
Kiki
This way.
Kiki
Err... Ah! There they are. Look, by the entrance.
Olivia
Wait a minute...

Olivia looks up at me, and I notice the anxiousness in her gaze.
Will
That's Queen Elizabeth's attendant...
Kiki
Huh? The queen?!
Olivia
Let's go.
Queen Elizabeth
Well met. It has been far too long, William Shakespeare and Olivia Berry.
Will
Yes...
Queen Elizabeth
No need to look so tense! I am merely a theatergoer today.
Will
O-Okay?
Kiki
Whoa, the queen brings her whole throne with her when she goes on escapades? Isn't it a bit... big?
Olivia
I don't think she'd be able to move about in secrecy if that's the case.
Will
Y-You're gonna get us killed! Shut it!
Queen Elizabeth
I grow restless if I'm not sat on my throne, so I secretly had it brought here to this theater of yours.
Will
I didn't even notice...
Queen Elizabeth
Visiting theaters in secret is a specialty of mine. There is no theater in this city that I cannot sneak into, throne and all.
Will
Th-That's remarkable!
Queen Elizabeth
Tonight's comedy was simply sublime, Shakespeare.  Truly, your performance elevates the good name of the Lord Chamberlain's Men.
Will
Thank you.
Queen Elizabeth
However... Do you know why I summoned you tonight?
Will
I... honestly have no idea, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
Olivia Berry.
Olivia
Yes, Your Majesty?
Queen Elizabeth
You were originally the leader of this troupe, correct?
Olivia
Yes.
Queen Elizabeth
Yet you don't stand on your own stage now. Why is that?
Olivia
...Because I'm a woman, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
Yes. You were allowed to perform for that one night only.
Queen Elizabeth
It is a regrettable state of affairs. I wish to see you perform again, truly I do. But you should know that will never happen during my reign, as much as I may want it to.
Queen Elizabeth
Isn't that right, Shakespeare?
Will
Yes, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
Well then, how would you explain to me this member of your troupe?
Kiki
Huh?
Queen Elizabeth
Why is this woman standing on stage, I ask.
Will
...
Olivia
...
Queen Elizabeth
No response, then?
Will
N-No, my Queen... She, uh, err, no! He...
Will
You have it wrong, Ma'am. He's actually a man.
Queen Elizabeth
...
Kiki
Ayup.
Queen Elizabeth
Hahah... Ahahah! Ahahahahahah!
 
Have you lost your mind, Shakespeare? You mean to tell me this beautiful specimen is a man?! Surely you jest!
Queen Elizabeth
I have seen many actors in my time, boy, but never have I seen a man like this.
Kiki
E-Eheheh.
Olivia
This is no time to blush at compliments, Kiki.
Will
N-No, Ma'am. This is no jest. He is, in fact, male... biologically, at least.
Kiki
Ayup.
Queen Elizabeth
So you shall play innocent, then.
Will
No, I...
Queen Elizabeth
Well, let us play along. Shall I ascertain the sex of this man of yours right here and now?
Will
Err, well... S-Sure? Go ahead?
Olivia
Mhm, mhm.
Kiki
Good by me!
 
You underestimate my mettle at your own peril. If you believe your resolute attitude will get me to back down, you are sorely mistaken.
Will
We'd never do such a foolish thing. You are welcome to ascertain as much as you want, Ma'am.
Olivia
Kiki, makes preparations so Her Majesty can ascertain properly.
Kiki
Okie dokie! Now, if you'll excuse me...
Kiki
Upsy daisy! Okay, here goes! Oop!
Queen Elizabeth
Wh-What in the world is this?!
Kiki
Huh? Is it hard to see?
Queen Elizabeth
L-Lord preserve! A real appendage! I-It's so imposing too! Goodness!
Kiki
I told you!
Queen Elizabeth
O-Obviously, you stuffed your underpants! It is fake!
Kiki
Feel free to touch.
Queen Elizabeth
T-Touch? Me? Touch th-that huge thing?!
Kiki
Feel free to slide your royal hand right in, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
Oh my!
Kiki
Make sure to go all the way down to the base so you can make sure it's properly attached.
Queen Elizabeth
E-Eep!
Kiki
I call that one the left squire, and that's the right squire.
Queen Elizabeth
I-I think the knight is putting on armor!
Kiki
O-Oh my.
 
Wh-What now?!
Kiki
I think we're getting ready to joust.
Queen Elizabeth
Pardon me?!
Kiki
Ah, yes! Right there, oooh...
Queen Elizabeth
E-E-Enough! I've, err, seen enough! No more!
Queen Elizabeth
Hah... Hah... Hah... Haah...
Will
How was it, Ma'am?
 
I-I reserve my impression, Shakespeare! P-Please, tell Kiki to put it away this instant!
Olivia
A respectable reaction.
Will
You heard Her Majesty, Kiki.
Kiki
Okay!
Kiki
It's gone now.
Will
The knight is gone.
Queen Elizabeth
M-Mhm...
Will
Can we keep employing Kiki as an actor, Ma'am?
Queen Elizabeth
I-If he or she or they are indeed male, I see no reason why not!
Will
Thank you for your kind understanding.
Kiki
Goodie!
Will
May we go back to the stage?
Queen Elizabeth
You may. Um, Kiki...
Kiki
Yes?
Queen Elizabeth
Your body is a veritable gift from the heavens. You must endeavour to perfect your craft as an actor.
Kiki
Thank you, Ma'am!
Queen Elizabeth
You may go now.
Will
With your permission.
Queen Elizabeth
Well then... That was a terrific experience.
Queen Elizabeth
There truly are so many different people in this country of ours.
Queen Elizabeth
And to think that they could grow quite so... robust...
