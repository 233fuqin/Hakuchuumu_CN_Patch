Despite all my hopes and best efforts...

Finding the place Mom's sketch is depicting in a book isn't proving easy.

But I've figured out a possible hint.

Mom really loved nature.

Mountains, forests, flowers, all that stuff.

She might have drawn that sketch after seeing those things crumbling around her in Nariyama due to the pigeons.

As far as I remember, the place we three visited the most together was...

A conifer forest in Fukushima.

It's an area of private land with a forest and a lake.

That's where Mom fell out of the canoe.

I often dream about one time the car broke down on our way there.

Back then...

We were heading to that very place when she told me that she'd already picked the spot.

Her smug smile makes more sense now.

In the end, Sumomo keeps coming to the library with me every day.

She spends a lot of time reading the magazines that strike her fancy, though.

But whenever she finds an article about my mom, she always makes sure to tell me about it.

And some of what she shows me is stuff I never knew, so it's certainly a big help to have her here.
Sumomo
Hey, Kanna, do you know this person?
Kanna
Hm?

She shows me a magazine published this very month.

There on the page is a man wearing a flashy shirt.

The ARTE of LA FOTOGRAFIA is a PASION!

The headline reads in big, bold letters, making me think for a second.
Kanna
Spencer Arashiyama? Of course I know him.

He's a famous photographer who appears frequently in various specialist magazines. No one knows his real age, and he speaks Spanish a lot.

His style and speech astound many, but no one can doubt his skill.
Kanna
He's probably the most famous photographer in Japan, after Mom died.
Sumomo
It says here that he had a good relationship with Anna and her family.
Kanna
Really?! Are we talking about the same person?
Sumomo
Look, he talks about Anna here. Maybe he knows your daddy too?
Kanna
...

I turn my eyes to the article Sumomo points to.

Photographers with the PASION that Anna had are far and few between.

She was simply overflowing with PASION for cars and nature.

I also had the pleasure of getting to know her FAMILIA.

Her TIMIDO and DULCE ESPOSO, as well as their little CHICO.

I shortly came to learn that her ESPOSO possessed a most CALIENTE FUEGO in his heart that rivaled even hers.

Meeting them, I learned that FUEGO in one's ALMA isn't always readily apparent.
Kanna
...

There's Spanish mixed in the text, so I have to read it over three times, even if it's admittedly easy to understand.
Kanna
You're right. It looks like he knew us.
Sumomo
The 'chico' he's talking about must be you, right?
Sumomo
And he had a lot of praise for your daddy.
Kanna
...Yeah.

I see.

It's shouldn't be a surprise to me that Dad and Mom have friendships I'm not privy to.

Still, it kind of feels like I'm seeing a new side to them that I never knew about before.

I flip through the magazine.

Then I stop on a page that catches my attention.
Sumomo
Oh...

It's a group interview featuring Mom, Dad, that Spencer friend of theirs...

And that young man named TAKUMA.
Sumomo
...

I try to keep my expression as neutral as possible as I turn the pages.

"When I saw your FOTOGRAFIA, I felt your AMOR for nature in a strong way."

"Why, it's very close to the PASION I see in Anna's art."

He does have a pretty unique speech pattern.

I will send this young man to Yale very soon.
Kanna
...

I feel the gulf between us growing larger and larger.

The realization that I haven't done anything as remarkable as him starts sinking in.
Sumomo
Sorry, I didn't notice.
Kanna
It's fine. Don't worry about me.

I turn the page again.

Their dialogue continues across six more pages of the magazine.
Kanna
Hm?

But on the very last page...

There's an advertisement encouraging readers to send in their pictures for Spencer to critique.

I want you to thoroughly burn me with your PASION!

Or so it reads.
Sumomo
Are you upset again?
Kanna
No...
Kanna
Let's buy a copy of this magazine on our way home.
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
I...
Kanna
Never mind. Let's get going.

We stop by a bookstore and pick up a copy of the magazine along with an envelope.

This magazine is published at the end of the month, so I just barely have time to send in my submission.

I don't have time to photograph anything new.

I cut off the proof of purchase from the magazine, which is necessary to apply for Spencer's critique.
Sumomo
Oh? You're not gonna read it?
Kanna
Nope. People who purchase the magazine can submit photos for critique.
Sumomo
Huh? You're gonna do that?

When I nod, Sumomo beams.
Sumomo
That's incredible! Which photos are you sending?
Kanna
I'm going to pick some now.
Sumomo
Let me choose them with you!

We choose the best of my pictures and print them out.
Azuki
Hm? What are you guys doing?
Sumomo
He's sending his photos to a professional photographer so he can look at them.
Azuki
Oh?
Sumomo
He's so cool when he's proactive, isn't he?
Azuki
So a professional, huh?

Azuki picks up the magazine from the sofa and begins flipping through the pages.
Azuki
This guy? Spencer Arashiyama?
Sumomo
Apparently he's a friend of Kanna's parents.
Azuki
That so? Then why don't you ask your dad to show them to him?
Sumomo
You just don't get it! He wants to try and make it on his own first! Right?
Kanna
Well, I think he might recognize the name on the letter.
Sumomo
That's fine! I'm sure he'll realize you didn't wanna use your parents and acknowledge how gutsy and upfront you are!
Sumomo
You'll make a way better impression than by trying to use your parent's name like other people do.
Azuki
Heh, you really are a cunning peach, eh?
Kanna
Mmh...
Sumomo
Oh, that's Halley's Comet.
Kanna
I took it at the camp.

I pick up the shot of the comet.
Sumomo
It's so pretty!
Kanna
I wasn't really feeling much when I took it.
Sumomo
Really?

I also pick up the picture of the sunset sky I took from inside the cave.

I was thinking of the composition of the sketch, so it kind of looks like it.
Sumomo
That's the one from the cave.
Kanna
If I send this...
Kanna
If he knows about the sketch, this might speak to him in some way.
Sumomo
Huh, makes sense.

That kind of feels like cheating, though.

These pictures will probably reach Spencer right after the comet is closest to Earth, or possibly right before.

And by then, I should have my answer about the place, regardless of what happens.

Ultimately, I can still ask Dad if I need to.

But that's my true last resort.
Kanna
...

I can only send one picture for him to critique.

It's no wonder.

Barring stuff like contests, it's rare for an active and famous photographer to offer critique like this.
Azuki
Oooh!

Azuki seems entertained by something in the magazine.
Azuki
Look at this brat! He's riding an SR! That's some good taste for someone so young.

I glance her way and recognize those pages. It's the discussion between Spencer and TAKUMA.
Azuki
And it has a custom suspension system. Man, this kid is pretty cool.
Sumomo
Azuki!
Azuki
Huh? What?
Sumomo
Don't read that!

Sumomo rips the magazine out of her hands.
Azuki
Why not?!
Sumomo
Because!
Azuki
Eh?
Sumomo
Boys are sensitive!
Kanna
It's fine, Sumomo.
Azuki
Huh? Oh, you know him or something?
Kanna
Not at all.
Sumomo
But they're the same age. I get why he'd feel self-conscious about him.
Azuki
Really? But you two are totally different people. Why're you getting self-conscious because of him?
Azuki
You like bikes and mountains now?
Kanna
...
Azuki
You're more the indoor type, aren't you?
Kanna
Yeah, I guess.
Azuki
Hmm?
Kanna
I don't feel self-conscious because of him. Sumomo's the one with that idea.
Sumomo
Ouch.

In the end, I decide to send the picture of the comet I took at the camp.

I also attach a brief letter.

It was really nice to read what you had to say about my mom in that article. I'm also aiming to become a photographer like her.

I would be grateful to read your comments on this photo of the starry sky. I took it while looking for the location of a sketch my mom left behind.

Yours sincerely, Amei Kanna.
Kanna
Okay.
Sumomo
It's ready?
Kanna
Yeah, I'll go mail it.
Sumomo
Sure thing! Be careful out there!
Azuki
He's around that age, eh?
Sumomo
Right? He's totally self-conscious about that other guy.
Azuki
Yup, no doubt about it.
Sumomo
Well, I get how it feels.

I flip through the magazine's pages.

Both the young photographer Kanna is self-conscious about and the apparently super famous one are good looking, but neither of them have that special something.
Sumomo
I wonder why he's so worried about him. Kanna's way cooler and better looking.
Azuki
Huh? You mean our Candy?
Sumomo
Is it kinda creepy for me to say? You know... I kind of really like Kanna, to be honest.
Azuki
Eh?
Azuki
Wait, what? You mean as in he's kinda nice to look at? Or as in, like, you wanna get it on?
Sumomo
Ahahah! You a virgin or something?
Azuki
I'm not a fucking virgin!
Sumomo
Well... I guess I would be lying if I said I'm not attracted to him in that way.
Sumomo
He's just so cute. I can't get him out of my mind.
Azuki
Uh... You sure that's a good idea? I mean, the age gap is kind of...
Sumomo
Yeah, you don't need to tell me.
Azuki
You like younger guys?
Sumomo
Nope.
Sumomo
I've always dated older men, never anyone younger than me. Though I guess I might've had a few one-night stands.
Azuki
Uh, how many guys have you been with?
Sumomo
Huh? How about you?
Azuki
Err, I don't think I can count them all.
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're a crappy liar!
Sumomo
I bet you can count them with just one hand.
Azuki
I can't! One hand's not nearly enough!
Sumomo
Jackpot! Ahahah, you're a treasure!
Azuki
It doesn't matter how many people I've been with!
Sumomo
Yep, we're on the same page there.
Sumomo
But then again... I wonder if Kanna thinks I'm a slut or something.
Azuki
Then why the heck did you talk about that in front of him? That's not the kind of stuff you bring up in front of the guy you like.
Sumomo
Really?
Azuki
Really!
Sumomo
But I always just say whatever comes to mind.
Sumomo
Haah, guess dating is off the table, huh?
Azuki
Heh, it's that dumbass we're talking about. Don't you think he might be a little wet behind the ears when it comes to girls?
Sumomo
Ahahah! Maybe.
Sumomo
Hey, Azuki.
Azuki
Now what?
Sumomo
How long are you planning to stay here? The car's almost fixed, right?
Sumomo
And when he takes his picture of the comet, I don't think there'll be any point to us sticking around anymore.
Azuki
Mmh, guess not.
Sumomo
He's keeping us secret from his daddy too. I don't think we can stay much later than the end of August.
Azuki
The heat is starting to get serious in here too.
Azuki
Why is Candy even living in the garage anyway? He doesn't get along with his dad?
Sumomo
Nah, I don't think it's that. His daddy just worries about him. He's a pretty serious guy.
Azuki
That so? We haven't even met, now that I think about it.
Sumomo
And we're nearing the end of July.
Azuki
Being honest, I guess that's about the time we should bounce.
Sumomo
Right.
Sumomo
So we have like one week left.
Sumomo
We have one last camping trip together, right?
Azuki
Hm?
Sumomo
Let's make sure we have tons of fun with it.

It's been a week since we camped out near Nariyama.

And during that whole time, my thinking hasn't shifted.

The more I think about it, the more I'm certain this must be the place I'm looking for.

It's the place I visited with my parents the most.

The owner of the land let us camp there since he was a fan of my mom, and I never saw anyone else around.

And most of the pictures in our albums are from that place.

Not to mention the lake surrounded by conifer forests.

If this is the place, I can understand my mom's smug smile when she told me about it.

It's outside of the prefecture.

So we can't exactly walk there.

However...

Since it's in a different prefecture, I can be fairly certain that the forest is still there.

And on July 25th, the starter that Azuki ordered finally arrived.
Kanna
It's on!
Azuki
Scrap Hunter for the win!
Sumomo
Ahahah! What's that supposed to be? Your war cry?
Azuki
Geez! Can you let me celebrate in peace?! What's your problem?!
Sumomo
No way! You say that often?
Azuki
No, I don't!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're cuckoo, girl!
Azuki
Shut it!
Kanna
This is incredible! Thank you, Azuki! Thank you so much!
Azuki
Heheh.
Kanna
It's working! We made it in time!
Azuki
If I say it'll be fixed, fixed it'll be!
Kanna
It's amazing! You're amazing, Azuki!
Azuki
Scrap hunter for the win?

I nod.
Kanna
Scrap hunters for the win!

Azuki nods enthusiastically.
Azuki&Kanna
Aww yeah! Scrap hunters forever!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You two are losing it!
Azuki
So, do we have a destination?

I nod and show them both a picture of the place.
Kanna
It's a private property in Fukushima. I think this should be the spot.
Sumomo
Yeah? Why?
Kanna
The old man at the reception the last time we came camping said the ecosystem around here had collapsed and the natural state had changed.
Sumomo
Yeah, right.
Azuki
Oh, so it's about the pigeons? It's true that we get a lot of 'em around here.
Kanna
I think she drew this sketch when nature around here started changing. And this is the place we visited the most after that.
Kanna
And there's a conifer forest here too.
Azuki
Conifers, huh? Sounds legit.
Azuki
It doesn't sound impossible, I guess.
Sumomo
So our next stop is Fukushima! How long is the trip?
Azuki
Four or five hours, give or take?
Sumomo
Whoo, long trip! But hey, we got the car now! We're just gonna drive there, right?
Sumomo
Maybe I can just go to sleep in the back and we'll be there by the time I wake up?
Kanna
We can't be in the camper while the car is running. It's the backseat for us.
Sumomo
Gotcha. Well, it'll be fun either way.
Azuki
When are we going? You want to catch the comet on the 28th, right?
Azuki
You wanna go a day or two before?
Kanna
Yeah, we should arrive two days in advance, just to be sure.
Kanna
If it turns out it isn't the right place, we can come back after staying the night and ask my dad about it.
Sumomo
Huh? Are you sure you wanna do that?
Kanna
There's not enough time, and I'd rather not miss a once-in-76-years chance over being stubborn.
Azuki
What if it's a place that can't be reached by car?
Kanna
Mmm...
Kanna
She said it's a place I know, so I'm sure we can drive there in a day of travel.
Kanna
Awh yeah! Scrap hunters forever!
Azuki
I see. Got it. So we leave tomorrow and either stay one night or two in a row.

I nod.
Kanna
Unlike last time, this is gonna be properly in the mountains, so we have to bring all our camping equipment.
Sumomo
We're going pretty far in the car this time, right? Are you sure you don't need to tell your daddy?
Kanna
...

I ponder for a bit and then nod.
Kanna
He's not on vacation yet. I think it'll be okay if we leave and come back while he's at work.
Sumomo
You sure you want to hide this from him?
Kanna
It's fine. I'm not a kid anymore.
Sumomo
Really? You think so?
Azuki
I'd say we've all been there. Right, Sumomo?
Sumomo
Right.

At 10 a.m. on July 26th, the three of us pile into my mom's Hachimaru and drive off.
Kanna
...

I'm in the passenger seat.

It's been so long since I felt Hachimaru's motor running.
Azuki
It purrs like a kitten. And there's nothing like the shudder you get from a diesel engine.
Azuki
Ain't it nice, Candy? I bet you could get hooked on this.
Kanna
Yeah!
Sumomo
Yahoo! Fukushima, here we cooome!
Azuki
Why the heck don't you have a license, Peach?
Sumomo
Huh? I never really needed one? I always had someone to drive me around.
Azuki
What the?! I can't believe you let a bunch of men turn you into a backseat potato!
Sumomo
I don't care, I put my efforts elsewhere. It takes work to look like the kinda girl suckers just wanna drive around, you know?
Azuki
Yeah, I get it, you huge slut.
Sumomo
Good, you granny.
Azuki
Who're you calling a granny?!
Kanna
Eyes on the road, please.
Sumomo
Ahahah! It's almost time! I hope we find the place in the sketch.
Azuki
We won't know till we're there.
Sumomo
I'm just saying it's nice to be here, all three of us, searching for something together.
Sumomo
Right, Kanna?
Kanna
Huh? Sure.
Sumomo
You want to take your pictures in that place for Anna, right? It's more about the journey, I'd say.
Sumomo
Granny Azuki really has no tact at all. She doesn't take her baths either.
Azuki
I've been bathing every day lately! And I smell like the pretty, feminine flower I am! I even use soap!
Azuki
Right, Candy? Ain't that right?
Kanna
Err, yeah. You also smell like cigarettes, though.
Azuki
It's the scent of a real woman!
Kanna
Yeah, uh, whatever...
Sumomo
Hey, guys, can't we play, like, music? You know, something for the ride.
Kanna
There should be some cassettes somewhere.
Azuki
Cassettes?! I've never seen those in real life! They work?! That's crazy!
Sumomo
This is so fun! It's like the car's our own private bubble!
Azuki
You finally see the light! This is what I've been talking about!
Azuki
Get yourself a license, girl. Cars are hecking fun.
Sumomo
It might be fun if I could drive a retro car like this, yeah.
Sumomo
Who used to drive when your mom was alive?
Kanna
Dad, most of the time. Mom was usually in the passenger seat, or the back seat.
Azuki
Oh, so she didn't drive? I had her pegged as the type that couldn't hand others the wheel.
Kanna
She drove herself when she was out working on her own, but it was mostly my dad driving every time we went out all together.
Azuki
So your pa likes cars, then?
Kanna
Probably.
Azuki
You were raised by two car enthusiasts yet you're not into them yourself?
Kanna
I guess. I like riding in them, though.
Sumomo
I know the feel. Sometimes it's nice just being driven around.

We drive on down the highway, stopping once at a rest area, and make it to Fukushima before sundown.

We drive through the rural landscape for a while. It kind of reminds of Nariyama City.
Azuki
We almost there?
Kanna
Yeah. Go left at the next turn.
Azuki
Aye, sir.
Kanna
Ah, it's here. At least I think it is.

I vaguely remember this mountain trail and the private house just off to the side of it.
Kanna
Wait here. I'll go say hi.
Azuki
Roger that.

The married couple that owns the land still remember me.

It's actually the first time I've seen them since my mom's passing.

After some small talk, I ask them for permission to stay on the mountain for a day or two.

The couple gleefully welcome me and give me a bunch of edible wild plants from the mountains and a bottle of sake from their home brewery.

They tell me it's because "both of them loved our sake." I figure they're talking about Mom and Dad. They probably expect me to be traveling with him.

I nod, thank them for the hospitality, and go back to the car.

I didn't lie to them. I simply chose what information to divulge.
Azuki
What's that?
Sumomo
Booze?
Kanna
Sake. And they gave us some wild vegetables, too.
Azuki
Oooh!
Sumomo
We're in heaven!
Azuki
You can say that again! I've half a mind to build my next hideout around these parts.
Kanna
I don't think they'd be too happy about that.

After we enter the mountain's dirt road, Azuki slows down Hachimaru.
Azuki
How far are we going?
Kanna
Just a bit further ahead. There's a river where the road opens up, so we always parked near that.
Azuki
A river, gotcha.

We park the car near our watering spot and lose no time in putting up the tent.
Sumomo
Is it just me or does this place seem much rougher than the last?
Azuki
This is real camping now. Last time was baby's first outing.
Sumomo
For real? I think I like baby camping.
Azuki
Those who don't work won't get any sake later.
Sumomo
Can't you see I'm working?! Didn't you see me hammering this stake thingie down?!
Azuki
Why did you come wearing those clothes anyway? We're in the middle of the mountain, not a damn runway.
Sumomo
I decided to make up for all those teacher training days looking like crap by dressing as fashionably as I want.
Azuki
You had enough of that dumpy little suit, eh?
Sumomo
I'd rather have a hard time moving then look like a lame-o. It's my choice!
Kanna
I'll go get some water.
Azuki
You handle yourself well, Candy. Glad to see one of you's an experienced camper.
Azuki
Candy, you gotta look for your spot, right? Get going before it gets dark.
Kanna
Uh, but we still gotta—
Azuki
Worry not. We're done with the big stuff. We fixed the car and drove all the way here for you. Don't fumble it now.
Kanna
...Thanks.
Azuki
You go with him, Peach. I wanna smoke.
Sumomo
Yippee! I'm coming!
Azuki
Take your time.
Sumomo
Are you looking for some kind of landmark?
Kanna
Not really. I don't really know my way around here that well.
Sumomo
Mmh, the trees do look kind of strange.
Kanna
...

We walk through the conifer forest, but I keep my eyes up on the sky.

The sun wanes before long.

The comet comes into view as the sky darkens.
Sumomo
This is a really nice place, I gotta say.
Kanna
Yeah, I like it too.

Walking through the forest brings back memories.

Memories of me and Mom exploring these woods together.

I haven't felt the excitement I used to feel back then in a long while.

Maybe that emotion is the reason my mom loved nature so much.
Sumomo
I'm, like, really happy.
Kanna
Hm?
Sumomo
You have a lot of memories with your Mom here, right?
Sumomo
It's nice to be here, knowing it means so much to you. Plus the air is clean, and it's quiet.
Kanna
...Yeah.
Sumomo
Makes me feel really glad to be here, even if it's just for a short while.
Kanna
...Isn't it kinda like this?
Sumomo
Hm?

Staring up at the sky, I superimpose the sketch over the view.

The tall conifers form a rough circle with Halley's Comet in the middle.

It's very similar.
Sumomo
Oh, is this the place?!
Kanna
I don't know.
Sumomo
Why not take a picture?
Kanna
Good idea.

I attach the wide-angle lens to my SLR camera.

It's the same kind of lens that TAKUMA guy uses.
Sumomo
Oh, this is so exciting!
Kanna
I took it.
Sumomo
Show me! Come on!

I show her the picture on the camera display.
Sumomo
Oooh! It's just like the sketch!
Kanna
...Yeah.
Sumomo
So this is it? This is the picture you wanted to take, right?
Kanna
...

I tilt my head to the side slightly.
Kanna
Honestly?
Kanna
I'm not really feeling much.
Sumomo
How about we wait until it's a little darker? We can't even see the stars yet.
Kanna
Yeah, right.

Somehow I don't think that's the problem.

This is...

Just not what I want to photograph.

Together, we wait for night to fall, listening to the sounds of nature and breathing in the clean air.

What did I come here looking for?

I had Azuki fix the car and drive me here, and I had Sumomo help me find this place.

And in the end...

Is it just going to end with me taking this picture and feeling empty?
Sumomo
Take a look at that!
Kanna
Hm?
Sumomo
It's so pretty.

I follow her gaze.

A blanket of stars twinkle in the sky like a box of gemstones.

And in the center, like a crown jewel, Halley's Comet arcing through the sky.
Sumomo
I'm so happy to be here! I never knew the night sky could look this pretty!

Instead of the night sky, I find myself staring at her instead.

The way the moonlight illuminates her rosy cheeks.

I...

I point my camera toward Sumomo's profile.
Sumomo
Ah, you took a picture of me?
Kanna
...Yeah.
Sumomo
Did I look cute?
Kanna
You always do.
Sumomo
Oooh, I like it when the proactive Kanna comes out to play.
Kanna
...

This time, I aim my camera up at the sky.
Sumomo
Did you get a good picture?
Kanna
...

I bring up the picture on the display. It looks just like the sketch's composition.
Sumomo
This is it! It's beautiful!
Kanna
Nah...

Then I display the photo I captured of Sumomo looking up at the sky.

It's the figure of an angel waiting for the night, and of her eyes sparkling at the sheer beauty of the sky above her.
Kanna
...Why did I never notice something so obvious?
Sumomo
Huh?
Kanna
Your picture is far more beautiful...
Kanna
More beautiful than Halley's Comet.
Sumomo
...

I feel the touch of something soft on my forehead as I look down at the screen, but the next instant it's gone.
Kanna
Huh?

When I raise my head, I see Sumomo smiling at me with an enraptured expression on her face.

She's blushing slightly.

I've never seen her like this before.

Her smile reminds me that she's a much more mature woman than she usually lets on.
Sumomo
That's to thank you for saying the most beautiful thing I've heard in my whole life.
Kanna
...

I point my camera at her again to capture this new smile.
Sumomo
Ahahah, there you go again.
Kanna
Yeah.

Now her smile has a tinge of embarrassment to it.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Stop it, geez!

Her expressions change so fast.

And I keep taking pictures for each new one.
Sumomo
Don't get too ahead of yourself.
Sumomo
That's the only kiss you're getting, for now at least.
Kanna
...

What did she just say?

Now I realize what it was I felt on my forehead.
Azuki
Oh, there you are. Did you get your picture?
Kanna
Yeah.
Azuki
Well, come on and show it to me.

I show her the picture of Halley's Comet I took in the little clearing.
Azuki
Oh, this is pretty good. So this is the place?
Kanna
I don't know.
Azuki
Huh?
Kanna
I don't know, and that's okay.
Kanna
I finally realized what it is I really wanted to photograph.
Azuki
Eh?
Sumomo
His ears are dry, I checked.
Azuki
...

Azuki gasps for some reason.
Azuki
Don't tell me you...
Sumomo
Of course not. What do you take me for?
Azuki
Right, I know.
Kanna
Uh, what are you guys talking about?
Sumomo
Never you mind. Now let's drink that sake you got!
Azuki
Count me in!

I toast with soda, and the two of them with sake.
Azuki
Man, it sure is cooler around here.
Sumomo
I know! The sake is delicious too. This rocks!
Kanna
I really wanna thank you two.
Kanna
Azuki, you fixed my car like you promised, and Sumomo, you helped me all those days in the library.
Azuki
Don't forget I drove us all the way here too.

I smile and nod.
Kanna
If I was alone, I probably would've found myself crushed under the weight of it all.
Kanna
I...
Kanna
I'm sorry I couldn't take a picture of the comet that'd capture people's hearts in the same way Mom's would have.
Azuki
Really?
Sumomo
I think your photo's plenty pretty.

I shake my head.
Kanna
I can tell the difference. I know Mom would've taken a way different picture.
Kanna
But...
Kanna
This time...
Kanna
I realized that the journey of getting here was more important than the destination.
Kanna
And I learned more than just that.

Both of you became my friends.

At least, that's what I want to say, but I can't find the courage to voice it out loud.

I'm too embarrassed.

I can tell them another time.

Because I'm certain.

No matter how much time passes while we're apart, I'll meet with them again.

I just know it.

I notice both of their smiles widening as I trail off.
Azuki
Well, if you're happy, then that's all there is to it.
Sumomo
Yep, that's it! We're just happy you brought us along for a fun camping trip.
Azuki
I don't think you two could've hauled all that camping equipment in and out of the car on your own.
Sumomo
So, are are going to stay two night? Or go back tomorrow?
Kanna
Either is fine by me. But it was a long trip to get here, so we might as well enjoy it a little longer.
Azuki
Huh? You really gonna let the 28th just pass by? Isn't it a big day for you?
Kanna
For my mom, yeah. I already took the picture of the comet that I wanted to take.
Kanna
And I had my realization while I was taking it.
Sumomo
Then we might as well leave tomorrow.
Azuki
Yeah, I'd say one day is more than enough. Need to get back and take a proper bath.
Sumomo
I'm sure you could live without one.
Azuki
I doubt you could, though.
Sumomo
I guess I could rinse my hair in the river, at the very least. I did bring my stuff.
Azuki
You'd do that? Maybe you're more suited to the great outdoors than you think.

We roast the food we brought and enjoy a long, relaxing dinner.

Time slips by peacefully.

Azuki and Sumomo have a blast drinking.

Watching them both, I realize that people get drunk differently depending on how they drink.
Azuki
Hey, Candy. What's the thing you want to photograph?
Kanna
Huh?

Azuki directs a question my way as she eats the cooked vegetables and noodles we prepared.
Azuki
You said you realized what you want to photograph, remember?
Sumomo
I wanna know too!

Both of them turn to me, their eyes inquisitive.

I look down at the cup in my hands.

I watch the leftover orange juice at the bottom sloshing around.
Kanna
People, I guess.
Sumomo&Azuki
People?
Kanna
You said it before, Azuki.
Kanna
I don't like cars and bikes in the same way you do.
Kanna
And I don't have a lick of fashion sense, like Sumomo does.
Sumomo
Ahahah.
Kanna
In the same way...
Kanna
I'm a different person than my mom.
Kanna
I kind of realized I can't drive the car around like she did and take beautiful pictures of the stars like her. It's just not me.
Azuki
I see now.
Sumomo
Mhm.
Kanna
But...
Kanna
I did have fun taking pictures of Sumomo.
Kanna
When I saw her expressions react to what I said, I felt something I never had before.
Kanna
For the first time, I felt that I was actually taking good pictures.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
So...
Kanna
I figure maybe what I really wanna photograph is people.
Azuki
Hold that thought for a second, now...
Azuki
Hasn't it occurred to you that maybe it's not that you like photographing people, but Peach specifically?
Kanna
...
Azuki
Simply put, doesn't that basically mean you like her?
Sumomo
Really?!
Kanna
No, uh, I...
Sumomo
...
Kanna
I haven't photographed anyone besides her, so I don't really know.
Azuki
Why not just come out and say you like her already, boyo?
Sumomo
No, hold up, I kinda like whatever this is.
Kanna
Well...
Sumomo
Well?
Kanna
I do think she might, uh, mean something to me.
Azuki
Oh boy. Why am I even here?
Sumomo
Ahahah! If we trace it back, you came to steal the car, right?
Azuki
Slander! He's the one who asked me to come look at it first!
Kanna
Oh, I did that, huh?
Kanna
Whoa, it's been a hot minute...

I remember the day I sent the letter to Azuki, asking that mysterious mechanic to come take a look at the car.
Kanna
It hasn't even been three weeks since then.
Sumomo
For real?! It feels like we've been together for three months.
Azuki
Word.
Kanna
Have you two thought about what to do after this?
Sumomo
After?

I nod.
Kanna
You're gonna go somewhere else when summer ends, right?

Both of them exchange glances.
Azuki
I suppose so, yeah. It's not like we can stay in the garage forever.
Sumomo
Where will you go, Azuki?
Azuki
I dunno. But it's gotta be a place where the roads are wide, so nowhere near Tokyo.
Sumomo
Maybe I'll follow you around for a while.
Azuki
Huh? Don't you have stuff to do? I mean, you're a college student, right?
Sumomo
Yeah, but I kinda wanna spend my time doing what I wanna do.
Sumomo
If I stick with you and visit lots of different places, maybe I'll find something.
Azuki
Fat chance, I reckon.
Sumomo
Huh? Really?
Kanna
Yeah, why not?
Azuki
You gotta sit down and think until you find it. I know you hate doing nothing, but that's the only way. You've gotta ask yourself.
Azuki
You only go and look outside after taking a long, hard look at yourself. It's the kind of stuff you can only find the answer to inside of you.
Azuki
It has nothing to do with where you are.
Sumomo
...

Sumomo stares at Azuki in disbelief.
Azuki
What?
Sumomo
Azuki, you...
Azuki
Hm?
Sumomo
You can totally tell you're in your thirties.
Azuki
I'm gonna throw you in the river!
Sumomo
Ahahah! Relax, it's a compliment! I mean it in a good way!
Kanna
You're not going back to college? What about your teaching license? Aren't you going to qualify?
Sumomo
Mmh, I don't know, but I don't think I'll need it anyway.
Kanna
Really?

With the same pleasant smile gracing her face, she nods. Then she takes a sip of sake and heaves a huge sigh of satisfaction.

I wonder if alcohol tastes as good as they make it seem.
Sumomo
You're the one who helped me realize that, you know?
Kanna
I did?!
Sumomo
Remember that photo you gave me? The one of me in Terminal 1?

I nod.
Sumomo
I really love that picture.
Sumomo
Seeing myself all happy and smiling in it made me realize that I just wanna be who I really am.
Sumomo
And I think my mom would prefer to see me like that too.
Sumomo
I know she just wants me to be happy.
Kanna
Right.
Sumomo
What I'm trying to say is that, thanks to you taking my picture, I discovered something inside of myself.
Sumomo
I realized something important, all thanks to your photo.
Sumomo
You're already changing people's lives with them!
Sumomo
And that's incredible! It's why I'm certain you'll become a great photographer.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Do your best. I'll always be cheering you on.

Suddenly, her smile looks a little more desolate.
Azuki
The hell do you guys think you're doing, getting all sappy on me?! I'm kind of feeling like a third wheel here, if I do say so myself!

I wash the dishes we used yesterday and hand them to Sumomo.

She thoroughly wipes each one dry with a towel and puts them back in their box.

While we're doing that, Azuki dismantles the tent in no time.

Morning up in the mountains is fresh and cool, and the air is as clean as ever.

The blue sky spreads above us and the sun shines brightly.

We pack up quickly with the cicadas cries as our soundtrack.
Azuki
All done. You sure we're good to go back?
Kanna
Yeah, it's fine.
Azuki
Okay, then.
Sumomo
You sure you didn't drink too much yesterday? You gonna be okay?
Azuki
I never get hangovers!
Sumomo
Oh, so you're one of those people who just goes wild for the night.
Azuki
I don't get drunk in the first place, you damn nag.
Sumomo
So she says, Kanna.
Kanna
She wasn't that bad last night. I'm sure it'll be fine.
Azuki
You wanna go say goodbye on our way out, right?

I nod.
Sumomo
Make sure to thank them for the sake, okay? It was sooo good!
Kanna
Yeah.

After thanking the old couple, we leave the mountain behind.

Once we've driven through the countryside and arrived back on the highway, Sumomo falls asleep in the backseat.
Kanna
She's asleep.
Azuki
Talk about shameless.
Kanna
Hm?
Azuki
Peach.
Kanna
Oh, right.
Azuki
I'd say a woman like Peach is perfect for a sweet, quiet guy like you.
Kanna
...She doesn't see me that way.

With her hands still firmly on the wheel, she glances at me for a second then sighs.
Azuki
You still have a ways to go, Candy.
Kanna
What?

The road back to Chiba was actually a little more congested than on the way to Fukushima.

Thankfully, though, we arrive back at the garage before night falls.

During the week, Dad gets home pretty late.

This way he won't notice the car was ever gone.
Sumomo
Can I take a bath already? I wanna drop dead.
Azuki
Go right ahead. I'm off to bed.
Sumomo
What? But you didn't take a bath yesterday! How can you sleep with yourself?!
Azuki
It's a survival skill, that's all.
Kanna
...

I yawn as I listen to them yapping at each other as usual.

Azuki's right. The trip was so tiring I could fall asleep on my feet.

But when I turn my drowsy eyes to the little wooden table...

What I see there wakes me right up.

Come to the house when you get back.

Never before has a note made me so nervous.
Kanna
Why did he come in here?

No, that's not the problem right now.

He must have come into the garage while we weren't here, which means...

He would have noticed Hachimaru was gone.
Sumomo
Oh? What's wrong, Kanna? Are you tired?
Kanna
It looks like Dad dropped by.
Sumomo
Huh?
Azuki
While we were away? Why?
Kanna
I don't know. But he must have seen that Hachimaru was gone.
Sumomo
That's bad, right?
Azuki
What did you tell him?
Kanna
I told him some friends were gonna be staying, and asked him to stay out.
Azuki
Friends? Like, from the academy?

All three of us are silent for a moment, before Sumomo speaks up.
Sumomo
Want us to go in with you?
Kanna
No.

That would just make it more complicated.
Kanna
I'll explain things to him. You two wait here.
Sumomo
Are you sure? It won't end up in a fight like last time?
Kanna
I don't know.
Kanna
But I have to try.
Kanna
...

My mind races as I try to figure out what to tell him.

How do I even begin to explain?

Do I tell him someone got sick and we had to rush them to hospital in the car?

No, they're supposed to be friends from the academy. He'd ask who was driving.

Maybe a brother or a sister of one of my friends?

Or their parents?

Any answer I can think of is convoluted at best.

I guess I just need to come clean.

Bracing myself, I open the front door and step inside.
Kanna
Huh?

I see my dad sitting at the table.

When he notices me, his expression hardens.

He's angry.

It's plain to see.

And sitting in front of my dad...

There's a man I recognize right away.
Dad
Where have you been?
Kanna
...
Spencer Arashiyama
Whoa, you've grown! You look just like Anna. How lindo.
Dad
Stay out of this, would you?
Kanna
Spencer Arashiyama? What are you doing here?
Spencer Arashiyama
You sent me your foto, right? It got me nostalgico, you see. So I came by to reminiscence.
Dad
We can talk about that later. Kanna, you fixed the car? Don't tell me you've been driving without a license.
Kanna
I haven't. I had my friend who has a license do the driving.
Dad
So those friends you told me about aren't from the academy?
Kanna
Er, well...

I stumble on my words and look down at my feet.
Kanna
No, they're not.
Dad
...

He lets out a huge sigh.
Dad
I thought you said were going to dedicate yourself to photography this summer? What have you been doing back there?
Kanna
It was all for that. I can explain.

I tell him how Azuki stayed over to repair Hachimaru.

And how my teacher finished her training and is now staying as well.

I also tell him that we all went out in the car together to photograph Halley's Comet.

I decide not to mention how Azuki stole the car, and I burned down her bus by trying to drive without a license.

I kind of twist the story into Sumomo introducing her mechanic friend to me after seeing that Hachimaru wasn't working.
Dad
So that teacher in training, huh?
Kanna
But I went back to the academy thanks to her. She did all that for me.
Spencer Arashiyama
Remarkable. This is truly excelente, Take.
Dad
Be quiet. This is an issue between father and son.
Spencer Arashiyama
Not quite. Just a minute ago, you were practically begging me to listen to what your chico has to say, remember?
Dad
The situation has changed.
Kanna
...

He did what?

He wanted him to listen to what his chico has to say?

...

Chico?

Uhhh...

Oh, right, it means "son." That's me.
Spencer Arashiyama
It hasn't changed at all. The pasion of this chico here to snap a picture of the comet managed to gain him the support of two more amigos.
Spencer Arashiyama
Truly, you are Anna's chico. I read your carta.
Spencer Arashiyama
Let me ask you one thing. Think hard, and try to be as honesto as you can in your answer.
Kanna
Okay.
Spencer Arashiyama
The foto you sent. Was that your best one?
Kanna
...

Slowly, I shake my head.
Spencer Arashiyama
Okey. Then we can keep talking. Are you able to prepare your best foto for me right now?
Spencer Arashiyama
If you can, I'll take a look at it. It's the least I can do after this grumpy old hombre here practically prostrated himself before me on your behalf.
Dad
I see you're still prone to running your mouth.
Spencer Arashiyama
Foto en mano vale mas que cien volando, my friend.
Dad
I have no idea what you're saying.

Spencer turns to me after having a chuckle at my dad's expense.
Spencer Arashiyama
So? Will you show me your most preciosa piece?
Kanna
Y-Yes!
Spencer Arashiyama
Go on then, ahora mismo. Get to it.
Kanna
I-I'll be back right away!
Azuki
Oh? Back so soon?
Sumomo
Was he mad?
Kanna
I-I'll explain later! Give me a moment!

In a rush, I grab the photo of Sumomo I printed for myself.
Sumomo
Huh? Is that my picture? What are you doing? Are you showing that to your daddy right now? Why?!
Kanna
Spencer Arashiyama's here!
Azuki
Who?
Sumomo
Th-The photographer?
Kanna
He asked me to show him my best photo, so I'm showing him this!
Sumomo
What is even happening anymore? Is this real life?
Azuki
Who's this Spencer Arashiyama guy? His name sucks.
Sumomo
So does yours.
Kanna
H-Here it is.
Spencer Arashiyama
Hm...

Spencer stares at the photo for what feels like a lifetime.
Kanna
...
Spencer Arashiyama
Chico.
Kanna
Yes?

That must be me.
Spencer Arashiyama
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Spencer Arashiyama
To be honesto, I came here after looking at the foto you sent to tell you that perhaps you should give up on becoming a fotografo.
Spencer Arashiyama
There was nothing of worth in the one you sent. So if that was the very best you could offer, bueno...
Spencer Arashiyama
You wouldn't amount to much more than simply being Anna's chico.
Kanna
I know...

He's right.

I'm the one who got myself into that situation.
Spencer Arashiyama
It made me feel a poquito sorry for you, so I came to tell you to your face. For the sake of the good amistad I share with your parents.
Kanna
...Right.
Spencer Arashiyama
But...
Spencer Arashiyama
You are hopelessly in love with this chica here, aren't you? I can see it as clear as day in this foto.
Spencer Arashiyama
Why do you point your camera to the cielos when you have such a magnificent subject? You should be photographing people.
Spencer Arashiyama
We're same, you and I. Personas rather than things.
Dad
Does he show promise?
Spencer Arashiyama
Sadly for you, he does. He has talento, or at least a measure of it.
Kanna
...

I have talent?

I can feel my heart beating faster.

I'm so happy.

My photo's been recognized by a photographer on the same level as mom was.
Dad
Don't praise him too much, it'll go to his head.
Spencer Arashiyama
You've become a proper papi. Truly, Anna was always right putting her trust in you.
Spencer Arashiyama
Chico.
Kanna
Y-Yes?
Spencer Arashiyama
Would you like to come and be my asistente? If you get a firsthand look at how a pro photographer works, no doubt you'll improve quickly.
Kanna
Y-Yes! I'd love to!
Dad
Hey, he's still a student.
Spencer Arashiyama
Then how about just the fin de semana? Weekends should be fine.
Dad
...
Kanna
Dad, can I?

After closing his eyes in silence for a long moment, he sighs deeply.
Dad
You'll go to class on weekdays. And I don't want to see your grades drop any further.
Kanna
I promise.
Spencer Arashiyama
Now, I'll issue some homework for you.
Kanna
Homework?
Spencer Arashiyama
I'm sure as Anna's chico, you are well aware of what day tomorrow is.

I nod.
Kanna
The day Halley's Comet is the closest to Earth. It only happens once every 76 years.
Spencer Arashiyama
Exactamente! So you will photograph it.
Kanna
...
Spencer Arashiyama
El jubilo on the faces of the people looking up at it, that is.
Spencer Arashiyama
The most wonderful thing about the estrellas isn't their own brilliance, but that of the people looking up at the sky.
Spencer Arashiyama
If their sparkle alone was enough, fluorescent lights would do the job.
Kanna
I'll do it.
Spencer Arashiyama
Buena suerte.

He stands up as he wishes me luck.
Dad
I'm sorry for taking up your time like this.
Spencer Arashiyama
Why, it's nothing. I can't say I had a bad time. After all, I got an excellent estudiante out of it.
Dad
He's in your hands.
Spencer Arashiyama
Leave it to me. He's yours and Anna's chico. I'll whip him into shape with as much amor as though he were my own.
Dad
That's good to hear.

My new teacher boards the taxi waiting for him in front of the house and leaves. I suppose I didn't notice it in my hurry.
Kanna
You asked him to come?
Dad
Hm?
Kanna
Spencer, I mean.
Dad
I know next to nothing about photography. After being with Anna for so long, I know how useless the opinion of an amateur is.
Kanna
I thought you were against it.
Dad
If I don't support your dream, Anna will never let me hear the end of it when we meet again.
Kanna
...
Dad
But this doesn't mean that I'm giving you permission to do whatever you want. Got it?

I nod.
Dad
Let me go say hello to your teacher. She's been looking after you, right? Is she in the garage right now?
Kanna
Uh, err, yeah, but...
Sumomo
Kanna!
Azuki
Did you get yelled at?
Sumomo
*Gasp*!
Azuki
Eep!
Dad
Oh? Where's your teacher?

I glance over at my dad.

I realize he never really met this Sumomo. He only saw her in that suit and wig.
Sumomo
Um, it's me. It's been a while.
Dad
Huh? That was you? You're the one who came to our house that time?
Sumomo
Yes, I-I...

Sumomo quickly goes to her bag and plucks the wig out of it.
Sumomo
See?
Dad
...Oh.
Sumomo
Ahahah, I'm sorry to intrude in your home.
Dad
Oh, don't be. I hear you've helped my son a great deal. Your friend is a mechanic, from what I hear?
Azuki
Eh?! Uh, yes... Though I prefer the term scrap hunter... Actually, yeah, mechanic is fine.
Dad
You managed to get the car working?
Azuki
Yeah. I changed the starter and replaced the parts that were wearing out.
Dad
Did you now?
Azuki
...Yes, Sir.
Sumomo
...
Dad
Kanna, you three have been sleeping out here?
Kanna
No, uh... Yeah.
Kanna
They sleep on the sofa and me in a sleeping bag.
Dad
It was rude of you to make them stay out here like that. I'm very sorry. It can't have been comfortable.
Sumomo
Oh, no, it's nothing! We're the ones who insisted on staying because we had no place to live. Kanna was nice enough to help us out. Right, Azuki?!
Azuki
Eh? Y-Yeah, right.
Azuki
That's right. Candy was nice enough to lend us the place.
Dad
Candy?
Sumomo
Um, we're leaving now, anyway.
Kanna
What?
Kanna
Today?
Sumomo
Yeah.
Kanna
Why?!
Azuki
Well, we've done what we set out to do. We were already planning to leave today.
Kanna
You didn't tell me anything about that.
Dad
It's late. If you'd like, please feel free to stay another night. Kanna, you go sleep in your own room, okay?
Kanna
...Okay.
Dad
I'll be back in the house.
Kanna
Okay.

Dad bows to Azuki and Sumomo then returns to the house.
Sumomo
Guess the jig is up.
Azuki
It's a miracle we weren't thrown out onto the street for trespassing, so I'd say we came out on top.
Sumomo
I think so too. Your daddy's a really kind man, Kanna.
Kanna
What are you two gonna do now?
Sumomo
Good question. I knew I couldn't live here forever, but I haven't really figured anything else out.
Sumomo
Maybe going back to Tokyo would be the right choice.
Kanna
And you, Azuki?
Azuki
I'll manage, one way or another. You worry about yourself, sweetie.
Sumomo
Oh, right! What happened with that Spencer guy?
Kanna
I showed him your picture.
Sumomo
And?
Kanna
He said I'm not bad and asked me to come work as his assistant. Only during weekends, though.
Sumomo
For real?! That's amazing! You did it! We should celebrate!
Azuki
So this Spencer guy or whatever. Is he, like, good?
Kanna
He's the most famous photographer in Japan. He has to be good.
Sumomo
He even appeared in that magazine!
Azuki
Mhm. Good for you.
Kanna
Yeah, but...
Kanna
You don't even have a way to get around yet, do you, Azuki? I'll ask my dad to let you stay for longer.
Azuki
That'd be nice, but...

Both of them stay silent for a moment.
Sumomo
Kanna, your daddy was really considerate to us just now. We can't just do that to him.
Sumomo
It'd be really stressful for everyone if he ended up being forced to tell us to leave, so we have to go on our own. We gotta be responsible adults for once.
Azuki
Way to pick a time to be responsible after staying in someone's garage without permission for weeks.
Sumomo
We're in the same boat, dummy.
Kanna
...

These two...

They're pulling the adult card now?

It feels like they're just using it an excuse to decide everything without me.

It makes me feel so frustrated.
Kanna
But why? Weren't we having fun together? You can still stay. I'm the only one using the garage anyway.
Azuki
Candy, you know as well as we do. We just can't.
Azuki
Your pa owns this place, remember? Eventually he's gonna tell us we have to leave, and that'll be his right.
Kanna
But...
Azuki
Thanks for everything, sweetie.
Sumomo
Yeah, I'll never forget the time we spent together.

Both of them smile at me.
Kanna
Why are you guys ending it like this?
Kanna
We were just getting into a groove.
Kanna
We can go visit tons more places in August.
Kanna
Hachimaru's working again and all.
Sumomo
Kanna, let's have a final photo session tomorrow.
Sumomo
Something to remember all the good clean fun we've had together these last few weeks.
Sumomo
Let's have fun... all the way to the end.
Sumomo
Okay?

Sumomo comes closer and gently strokes my head.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
And then we can all watch Halley's Comet together. You can call your daddy to join us too.
Kanna
Why would I ask him to join?
Sumomo
I want to say goodbye properly and thank him for letting us stay.
Sumomo
And it'll take even more time for you two to make up if you pull away from him again now.
Sumomo
I'm sure Anna would've loved to see the comet with her family. And I'm sure she'll be smiling down on you two from Heaven if you spend it together.
Kanna
...

I feel like what she's saying is right.
Azuki
Yeah, a bird doesn't shit up the nest when it's about to leave. And we scrap hunters are like birds, flying from place to place.
Sumomo
Ahahah! I bet that sounded cooler in your head!
Azuki
I'm not lame, for the love of God!
Kanna
...I'll tell Dad.
Sumomo
Okay. We still have some sake left over from the last camp, so tell him we can drink that together. I'll put it in the fridge.
Kanna
Okay.

I leave the garage, and the two of them, behind.
Sumomo
Aww, we got busted. We did something bad, huh?
Azuki
To who?
Sumomo
To Kanna and his daddy.

Flopping down onto the sofa, I stare up at the ceiling.
Sumomo
What are we gonna do now?
Azuki
What d'you mean? We gotta leave. There's no way around that.
Sumomo
Yeah, but Kanna looked really down.
Sumomo
He wasn't even going to class before we came around. You think he'll be okay?
Azuki
Hang on, I thought you were done with the whole teaching thing?
Sumomo
I'm not saying it as his teacher! I'm worried because I like him.
Sumomo
Will things get worse between him and his dad? Will it be my fault again?
Azuki
His dad seems like a good guy. I mean, he raised that little guy well.
Sumomo
He sure did. Kanna's really fortunate.
Azuki
Hopefully he realizes that himself soon.
Sumomo
*Sigh*

Summer memories flash before my eyes.

None of them are memories from before I came to the garage, and that makes me realize...

I really had a lot of fun here, huh?
Sumomo
I wonder if Kanna will remember the time we spent together fondly.
Azuki
Whoa, you're way more pure-hearted than I thought.
Sumomo
I told you, I'm a genuine pretty gal. Though I'm just a pretty gal.
Azuki
How about just telling him already? Might as well hit on him, while you're at it.
Sumomo
That's a crime! Think of poor little Kanna. He'd have a heart attack.
Azuki
Come on, make your move. No one will know.
Sumomo
You think so?
Azuki
Go for it, girl!
Sumomo
...Guess I might just do that.

When I enter the living room, I see Dad washing dishes in the kitchen.
Kanna
Dad.
Dad
What is it?
Kanna
About tomorrow night...

He looks up at me.
Kanna
Sumomo asked if you'd like to watch the comet with us from the garage.
Dad
Sumomo?
Kanna
The teacher. She said she wanted to say a proper goodbye before leaving.
Dad
I see. All right.
Dad
But you got an assignment from Arashiyama, didn't you? Don't you need to go out to take photographs?
Kanna
I'll go take some nearby. I think people will be gathering at the academy to see the comet, too, since it's got great views of the sky.
Dad
Okay. Tomorrow night, then. I'll see you there.
Kanna
Also...
Dad
Hm?
Kanna
There's something else I wanted to talk to you about.
Kanna
Haah...

After speaking with Dad, I got ready for bed and headed to my room.

Even though I'm in my own room, I can't relax.

Strangely enough, I'm already used to the sweltering heat of the garage and the hard, cramped floor of the camper.

I look out the window to the garage.

I can see light shining from the skylight.

Sumomo and Azuki must still be up.

I wonder what they're talking about.

By tomorrow, they'll both be gone.

I close the window screen and lay on my bed.

The room is cold from the night breeze.

I stare at the ceiling and think about what happened today.

Dad called that man, Spencer Arashiyama, for me.

This whole time I lived in the garage, Dad was looking out for me in his own way.

The sadness I saw in his eyes the first time Sumomo came to the house flashes in my mind.

It's just as he said.

I've been such a child.

Why didn't I ever try to be honest with the person who has always cared about me?

I can't help but wonder what went through his mind after he went out of his way to call Spencer Arashiyama here and learned I invited strangers to his garage.

Disappointment, most likely.

No, perhaps sadness again.

It's no use thinking about it.

As my gaze wanders out the window, I see the comet streaking the sky.

Tomorrow will be the day the comet is closest to Earth, finally.

The last day the three of us spend together.

"You are hopelessly in love with this chica here, aren't you? I can see it as clear as day in this foto."

I recall Spencer's words, and they make me think of her.

I think of all the expressions Sumomo has shown me.

She has taught me something I feel I should have known all along.

Watching her just be herself despite everything, no matter what anyone says.
Kanna
El jubilo on people's faces, huh?

It's just like he said.

Azuki also spoke of it once.

I do love her.
