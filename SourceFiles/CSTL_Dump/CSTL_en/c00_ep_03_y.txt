Yonagi
Actually, what happened to Izumo? Where is she?
Kaito
...

Oh boy...

I feel the blood begin to drain from my face.
Kaito
Funny you should ask...
Kaito
She's living here with me.
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
She helps me with the housework, and sends information about this place to the participants of the virtual space, so... yeah.
Yonagi
She's in the cabin? As in, right now?

We fearfully lift our faces and look around the cabin.
Izumo
Good morning.
Kaito
Morning.
Yonagi
...How long have you been there?
Izumo
From moment you started undressing.
Yonagi
Eeep!
Kaito
Izumo, um, we just, uh...
Izumo
Mm?
Kaito
...want to thank you for everything.
Yonagi
Where did that come from?!
Izumo
Should I excuse myself?
Yonagi
J-Just for a bit, please! Can you leave us alone for a minute?
Yonagi
There's so much we need to talk about!
Yonagi
But... let me put on clothes first, please...
Izumo
I will wait.

She says, before quietly leaving the room.
Yonagi
SHE SAW US DOING THE DIRTY!
Kaito
Well, she's always monitoring out biometrics, so she'd know what we were up to anyway.
Yonagi
That's not the issue here, you goober!
