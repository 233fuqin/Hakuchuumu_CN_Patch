But...

I can't remember anything before that.
????
Huh? I...
????
...

I scan the room slowly.

Next to me is a bed just like mine.

The two beds are the only things in the otherwise stark and empty room.

Where am I? Who is she?

Who am I?

I put a hand to my forehead and think.

I can't remember a thing.

All I can recall is the dream I just had.
????
Were you sleeping too?
????
...

The girl doesn't answer.

Upon further inspection, I realize she's not even really looking at me.

She's just staring blankly in my general direction.
????
...

Just then, the door to the room opens.

Another girl comes into the room.

And beside her, hovering in the air, is a small robot made up of spheres like a snowman.
????
Good morning.
????
Uh...
????
I imagine you have questions. This way.

She abruptly turns her back on us.
????
Err, um...
????
Yes?
????
...

The white-haired girl trots over to the open door, barefoot.

Seeing this, the other girl walks to the bed and picks up a pair of sandals before returning to the doorway.

She doesn't seem to mean us any harm, at least.
????
Are you coming?
????
Uh, okay.

I hurriedly get to my feet.

The polished white floor feels warm against my soles.

I notice a pair of sandals lined up beside my own bed. I put them on and hurry to the exit.

The interior of the whole place appears consistently drab.

Everything feels unnatural and inorganic.

And yet, I can smell a faint trace of a wooden scent.

The corridor is also warm.

The whole place seems to maintain a placid temperature.

As we walk, I think of what questions to ask.
????
Here.

The girl places a big, round plate in front of me.

She does the same for the white-haired girl.

The two plates are set perfectly perpendicular to each other.

But she doesn't do the same for herself. Maybe she ate before.

I wonder to myself as I scoop up some food with my spoon and bring it to my mouth.

It's a slightly sweet porridge-like substance.

It warms me up and makes my stomach clamor for more.

I spoon bite after bite into my mouth.

Then, I raise my face.

I see that the white-haired girl is also eating.

The other girl simply stares at me in silence.
????
Um...
????
Yes?
????
Where are we?
????
This is a facility called the Environmental Redevelopment Research Institute.
????
That's, uh...
????
The research facility's main goal is to create a safe surface environment where humans can subsist.
????
I see.

I think I asked the wrong question.

I understood most of the words she said.

I understand what she's saying in general.

No one can live on the surface.

That's obvious. Anyone could tell you that.

What I want to know is...

How much memory do I retain?

For example, I know that this is a plate, and I recognize what a spoon is.

And when she mentioned what kind of facility this is, I felt a vague sense of familiarity at the term.

Academia, researchers, white coats, test tubes.

It conjures a certain image in my mind.

But I can't recall anything about myself.

I can't see myself in any of the scenes my mind conjures.
????
Um, so you know who I am?

The girl nods.
????
Your name is Kaito. That is all the personal information you need to know right now.
Kaito
Kaito... then. You know more about me, don't you? Like my occupation? My age?

The girl nods.
Kaito
But you can't tell me?
????
This information restriction is not permanent. When the time comes, you will be informed of everything.
????
But that moment isn't now.
Kaito
Am I being held here for some reason?

She shakes her head.
????
You gave your consent to everything that's happening here.
????
You agreed to your memory being tampered with and to the tests being run in this facility.
Kaito
Before I lost my memory, you mean?

She nods again.
Kaito
What do you mean by tests? Who's running this place?
????
The activity of your cerebral cortex is being recorded during sleep. Your role is to sleep in the designated room.
Kaito
Huh?
????
In short, we are recording your dreams.
Kaito
Wha...
????
The facility provides for all your biological needs so that you are free to dream.
????
That is your role here.
Kaito
I consented to my memory being wiped for this experiment?

She nods.
Kaito
There's no way for me to know if what you're saying is true. I have no memories at all.
Kaito
You could be feeding me lies here.
Kaito
Do you have any proof as to why I should believe you?
????
No.
Kaito
...
????
Even if you don't believe me, that has no bearing on the recording activities being performed.
????
Whether you think I'm lying or not, you cannot leave this facility.
????
No matter how hard you fight it, you will sleep eventually sleep. And I will record it.
????
Once you have done that for a sufficient amount of time, your role will be over and your memories returned.
????
I would point out that there is nothing that can cause you harm in this place.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito
So you're the one who's making these recordings?

She nods once more.
Kaito
Who are you? An android?

She nods again.
????
You called me Izumo.
Kaito
Izumo... Are you a medical android?
Izumo
I have not been granted permission to perform medical care. I am registered as a home assistance terminal. I am capable of assisting with academic research and monitoring biosignals.
Kaito
I see...
