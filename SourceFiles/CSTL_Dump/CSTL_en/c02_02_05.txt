Between lazy yawns, I trudge through morning prep work at the pub.

I ended up spending all night touching up the lines for every character.

As I reach for the next potato to peel, the front door opens.
Olivia
Good morning.
Will
You again? By the Lord's bones...
Olivia
You've no intention of coming to the rehearsal, do you?
Will
I told you yesterday. I'm not some noble who can afford to waste his time on hobbies.
Will
I can't play around with you.
Olivia
The pub opens at night, right?
Will
And I need to prepare everything before that.
Olivia
I'll help you.
Will
What?

Are my ears functioning?

No, surely she didn't say what I thought she said.

I'm imagining things.

But as I struggle with my obviously failing senses, Olivia comes stomping up to the counter.
Will
H-Hey, knock it off.
Olivia
You're working with your nails in here, huh? I'm surprised you can make any kind of food with this lack of equipment.
Will
Ugh.
Olivia
Oh, I see. You just mash potatoes and serve them like that.
Olivia
Does no one complain about this? I find it a little unbelievable.

Olivia rummages around  behind the counter for a bit.
Olivia
I've got the hang of how you handle things around here. Do you have a price list or something handy? A menu of the insipid grub you give customers?
Will
No, uh, we don't.
Olivia
How can you be THIS incompetent?
Will
Ah, shut up! I'm the only one manning the counter, so it's all in my head!

Olivia walks back out into the room and opens up the bag she brought with her on one of the tables.

She takes a piece of paper from it.
Olivia
Just write down whatever you have a set price for here. I have it in good confidence that you are at least capable of writing.
Will
N-No, wait!

Olivia stops and looks at me.
Will
I'm sorry, but my father and I have always run this pub together. We've never let anyone else work here.
Will
And we don't even have the money to hire any help. We have a hard enough time feeding ourselves as it is.
Olivia
Are you trying to mock me? How could I ever accept money from the likes of you?
Olivia
And didn't you say this pub is important to you? Are you trying to get it shut down? No one but the regulars will put up with this sub-par service.
Will
If you could stop running your mouth, it'd be—
Olivia
It'll be bad for me if you can't focus on theater.
Olivia
That's why I came to help you. Very much despite myself, I'll have you know.
Will
You...
Olivia
What?
Will
Are you just really bored?
Olivia
I'm going to impale you.

Just then, my father comes down the stairs.
Father
Hm? I recognize that voice...
Father
The customer from yesterday is gracing us today as well?
Will
No, uh, I'll have them leave right away.
Olivia
Too bad for you, because I'm not leaving.
Will
Shut up!
Father
Ahahahah!

My dad laughs out loud as he makes his way to his usual seat at the end of the bar.

Olivia watches him closely.
Olivia
Boss...
Father
Hm? I'm more of a decoration than a boss these days.
Will
But you are the owner of the pub.
Olivia
Are you eating properly?
Will
...
Olivia
I didn't notice yesterday, but seeing someone this sickly at the bar will only make the awful meals look worse.
Olivia
And they already look barely edible to begin with.
Father
You been running your mouth again, Will?
Will
I didn't say a thing.
Olivia
All it takes is one look at that emaciated face. Your skin and lips are all dry; it's obvious you're not even drinking enough water.
Father
You can take that complaint to my son here. He doesn't let me drink.

Olivia snaps back to me.
Olivia
Why not?! Are you torturing him? Do you want to kill this man? Aren't there better ways to go about it?
Will
He's talking about ale.
Olivia
Liquor isn't water. It'll only dehydrate you more.

Olivia turns back to my dad and almost slaps him across the face with her words.

Ed said the same thing.

Literally everyone does.

It's about time Dad realizes that him and alcohol just aren't meant to be.
Olivia
I'll make you some porridge. Do you have any milk?
Will
We don't really buy stuff that spoils that fast.
Olivia
You're the absolute definition of incompetence.
Will
That's uncalled for!
Olivia
I'll go buy some. There'd better be some hot water waiting for me when I get back.
Will
H-Hey!

With that, she stomps out of the pub without another word.
Father
You found yourself an odd friend there, eh?
Will
She's not my friend.
Father
Oh, is that so? So your master, then. She did call you her slave.
Will
Not you too...

My dad has a laughing fit, which soon morphs into a coughing fit.
Olivia
Eat up.

Olivia serves two bowls of milky porridge in front of us.

She even puts the spoon in Dad's hand.
Olivia
So it's not like you lost your sight completely.
Father
Yeah. I still have a little left—I can just about make out what's in front of me. Thanks, lass.
Olivia
I'm not some lass, my name is Olivia. Do you want to get killed too, old man?
Father
Ahahah!
Olivia
What are you laughing at? I see discourtesy runs in the blood with you two.
Father
Sorry, didn't mean to ruffle any feathers. Olivia, yes?
Olivia
Can you eat it? You really need to. I went through the trouble of making it, so you better eat it all.
Father
Yes, yes.

Smiling from ear to ear, Dad enthusiastically brings a spoonful of porridge to his mouth.

I stare at the scene in disbelief.
Olivia
What are you gawking at?
Will
Uh, nothing.
Olivia
Hurry up and eat or we'll be late for rehearsal.

I do as she says and take my own bite of the fresh, steaming porridge.
Will
Mmh...
Father
This is good.

It has a warm, mellow texture, and the sweetness spreads throughout my mouth.
Olivia
*Giggle*♪
Will
It's really good. I'm amazed you could actually make something tasty in that kitchen.
Olivia
Don't lump me in with the likes of you.

This is surprising, to say the least.

Nobles always leave things like this to others. I had them pegged for the kind of people that can't do anything on their own.

I spoon down more of the hot porridge, enjoying the sweet goodness warming my stomach.
Olivia
Those potatoes...

Olivia is looking down at the pile of potatoes stacked beside the bar.

I chase her gaze to the potatoes then turn back to her.
Will
I usually turn them into mashed potatoes.
Olivia
I see. So that's what happens when an incompetent man can't cook to save his life.
Will
Did mashed potatoes kill your parents or something?

Olivia turns to my dad.
Olivia
Boss, I actually want to borrow your son for a while.
Olivia
Though I suppose he is already my property.

Olivia's tone is disgruntled.
Will
You're gonna give people the wrong impression.
Father
Hm? I thought he was incompetent? What d'you want him for?
Will
Hey...
Olivia
He is incompetent when he's here.

Olivia glances at me.
Olivia
But that's not the case in a troupe. He won't be incompetent there.

Dad raises his face in her direction, still taking spoons of porridge to his mouth.
Olivia
Our troupe needs the plays he writes.
Olivia
That's why I'll come help here so he has time for the theater. That's okay by you, right?
Will
Wait, hold that horse. I enjoy working in the pub.
Will
I promised to write scripts for you. I can do that while also doing my job here.
Olivia
Don't you remember what we talked about yesterday? You need firsthand experience on stage.
Olivia
You won't be able to demonstrate your true talent until you experience a performance with real actors and a live audience. You can write better than you do now.
Father
Well...
Father
This doesn't seem like something that's up for me to decide.

My dad faces forward as he speaks, still eating his breakfast.
Will
That's not the problem, Dad. This pub is... you know...

This is a gathering place for Catholics.

My dad wants to protect the freedom of religion.

I can't say that in front of Olivia, though.

Not with a queen who executes Catholics on the throne.

And Olivia is one of the nobles serving under her.

If we let her hang around in here, we could all end up hanging from the gallows.

Does Dad understand the danger we're in?
Will
Um, I don't think we should let just anyone work here.
Father
That's about the pub. You can decide what to do with yourself. You're already a man who can make his own choices.
Father
Whatever you decide, no one here will fault you for it. Do you understand?

Dad looks straight at me.

He's probably talking about the people who gather upstairs.
Will
...
Olivia
I'll help with the preparations, but I'd like you to open later. In exchange, I'll work behind the bar to help keep sales up.
Will
Huh?! You want to serve people too?!
Olivia
Rehearsal lasts well into the night. You can't open in the evening, so there's no other choice but to increase the number of patrons.
Will
I... guess?
Father
It sounds like she has a plan, and a good one at that. We're always told this place needs a feminine touch. And you cook a lot better than Will ever could.
Will
Are you sure we don't need to think about this a bit more?
Father
Just like you said, I don't think we should let just anyone work here. But I think this lass will be fine for the job.
Olivia
I'm not some lass. The name's Olivia.
Will
But you only just met her!
Father
There are things one can see in a clearer light when you have your eyes closed. Remember that well, Will.
Will
...
Father
Thank you very much. That was good, Olivia. Make me some more tomorrow.
Olivia
Of course, my food is nothing short of heavenly.
Father
I got something to look forward to, then.
Olivia
So, it looks like we've reached an agreement.

Olivia turns back to me.
Olivia
Now you have no reason to decline, do you?
Will
...
Olivia
Today's rehearsal starts at noon. I shared the script with the actors yesterday.
Olivia
We set off as soon as we're done prepping here. Hey, what are you doing? Get a move on, this is your bloody pub!
Will
...Is this really okay?

Things are moving too fast for me.

It feels like I'm getting yanked around on a leash.

I trot alongside Olivia as we make our way through the busy streets.

She's fresh as a daisy despite the exertion.

While I feel like a pile of manure.

We arrive, and Olivia goes straight backstage. When she comes back, the whole troupe is with her.
Will
...

There's another girl among them.

How in the world is this troupe allowed to perform?

Are they all desperate enough to work under a female troupe leader?

I suppose two women isn't much worse than a single one. It only takes one to get you executed anyway.
Olivia
Everyone, we'll begin rehearsing a new act today. And we have a new member.

Olivia says, then turns to me.

All the eyes of the troupe are on me now.
Olivia
His name is William Shakespeare. Our new playwright. We'll be rehearsing one of this scripts today.
Olivia
And he'll be acting too.
Olivia
I divided up the scripts already, so I'll be giving one to each of you.
Will
Um...

Olivia turns back to me, and so does everyone else.
Olivia
What?
Will
I made some more revisions last night.
Olivia
Really? To which character's parts?
Will
All of them.

Her eyes widen in surprise, and then she scowls at me.
Olivia
And why didn't you open your bloody mouth about this earlier? Please tell me you at least brought the revised script.
Will
No, but I remember all of it.
Olivia
All of it?! You remember all the new dialogue?
Will
Yeah, let me see everyone's scripts. I'll fix them up.
Will
I don't know the tone of anyone's voice but yours, though, so I might end up revising the others' lines again.

I make amendments to each script on the spot.

Olivia zealously goes over the new lines as I write them.
Olivia
I think this improves things. We haven't learned the lines yet, so let's go with the revised version.

She raises her face from the last page and looks at me.
Olivia
It's magnificent. Thank you.

Her eyes glitter with an innocent, girlish energy. It's a complete change from her usual high and mighty attitude.

Then, she hands me a script.
Olivia
This is your role. Fix it up for yourself.
Will
Huh? Sure.
Will
What?!

I can't help but voice my surprise upon reading the script.
Olivia
What's wrong?

The lines here are the ones for a character named Hermia.

She's the target of the affections of two men in the play.

I wrote her as a young lady.
Will
I'm playing Hermia?!
Olivia
Yes?
Will
That's a woman's role!
Olivia
Hm?

Olivia looks at me quizzically.
Olivia
What about it?
Will
Why am I playing a woman?!
Olivia
You have a high-pitched voice, your face is pretty enough, and you don't have that much body hair.
Olivia
You fit this role the best.
Will
How about you do it?!
Olivia
I can't play a woman, despite what you may think.
Will
Why?! You were pretty much born for it!
Olivia
If I play a female part, I'll be found out. I'm too pretty.
Olivia
Didn't you say yourself that women shouldn't be on stage? Therefore it's only natural for men to play the female parts.
Will
W-Wait, what? What about that girl?!
Kiki
Me? I'm a guy, though? I have dangly bits and all.
Will
Uh, d-dangly? As in, between your legs?! Why?!
Kiki
Why? Because I'm a guy, silly.
Will
A guy! A bloke! But how?! You're so cute and adorable and pretty!
Kiki
Eheheh.
Olivia
He is quite the looker, isn't he? His name's Kiki, a fellow slave of yours.
Will
A fellow slave?
Kiki
A pleasure!
Will
Yeah, uh, my pleasure... Wait! Why am I playing a woman again?!
Olivia
Okay, everyone, take some time to read through your lines. You can take your scripts with you.
Olivia
Commit all your lines to memory before the day ends. We will strike back on the last day of the Admiral's Men's performance.

Despite my protests, the rehearsal gets under way.
Will
Admiral's Men...
Kiki
They're our rivals.

Kiki whispers into my ear, which sends shivers up and down my spine.
Thomas
To be rivals, I'd think you need to have a semblance of equal footing.

A particularly lanky member of the troupe talks into my ear from the opposite side to Kiki.
Will
So... which troupe is the losing one?
Thomas
Ah, don't make me spell it out.

He and Kiki begin giggling among themselves.
Thomas
Ah, where are my manners? The name's Thomas. Which happens to be this one's real name, actually.

Thomas says, pointing at Kiki.
Kiki
Eheheh!
Will
So you're both Thomas.
Kiki
I was told to crossdress and change my name because it was getting annoying to have two people with the same name. That's why I'm Kiki now. The chief probably forgot my real name by now.
Will
That's tyranny! And you're okay with it?!
Kiki
You get used to it.
Will
By the bones of...

Ah, just forget it.
Will
So, is the difference that big between this troupe and the Admiral's Men?
Kiki
There's a world of difference.
Olivia
The distance between the clouds and the ground can be easily closed.

Olivia snaps back.

Kiki and Thomas go silent in the blink of an eye.
Olivia
With Will's writing, that is.
Kiki
Whoa, she's really talking you up.

The two of them begin poking fun at me with wide grins on their faces.
Olivia
Are you done chitchatting? Let's begin.

Olivia begins to read the narration out loud for everyone while pacing back and forth.

I look down at my script and follow along.
Olivia
This won't work at all.
Olivia
This is so ghastly that words fail me. It's just no good.
Will
You don't need to tell me, I know it's bad.
Olivia
How can you be embarrassed in front of our troupe members?
Olivia
When this place is packed with the audience, you'll need to project your voice loud enough for them to hear you on the third floor.
Will
I'm aware, it's just that...

For a moment I thought there was something off with my script.

But that illusion was quickly dispelled.

The level of the troupe members here is so low it's obvious even to an amateur like me.

And I'm far worse than even the lowest of them.

I realized as soon as I tried.

Why am I even here? This whole acting thing is Greek to me.

A little spot of regret starts to sprout inside my chest like an insidious vine.
Olivia
You're too stiff, and you seem to know absolutely nothing about women.
Will
You don't need to tell me that...
Olivia
Didn't you write this?

I give a weak nod.
Olivia
It's so strange. You write women so well.
Olivia
So why can't you express it on stage?
Olivia
How about we go to a brothel so you can get rid of that virginity?
Will
Hey!

Her eyes widen in surprise.
Olivia
See? You can raise your voice!
Will
Is this normal practice for an acting troupe?! I hardly think all this criticism is constructive! We're not gonna get anywhere at this rate.
Kiki
I can't speak for other troupes, but this is how things usually are with us.
Will
How do you not know? Does no one know how the competition operates?
Thomas
The ones good enough for that go to other troupes, obviously.
Will
Is this a troupe of rejects?
Olivia
Insult us as much as you like, but we're working with what we have. Moaning and complaining won't change a thing.
Olivia
I'm used to being being looked down upon.
Olivia
If you want to talk behind my back and blame me, feel free. I care not for what you say behind the scenes.
Olivia
But when I'm here, you all are...
Olivia
...my slaves. Do not forget that.
Will
...

The air in the theater freezes over.

Is it really possible for them to excite an audience like this?

I see nothing but low spirits and slumped shoulders among the other troupe members.

Everything Olivia points out is sound, which only makes being here more unbearable.

For the most part, I simply wait for it to be time to leave.

And I feel like I'm not the only one taking this approach.

I simply pray that Olivia doesn't feel like focusing on me and wait for the rehearsal to end.

Our unproductive rehearsal drags on until evening.

When Olivia goes backstage, Kiki and Thomas approach me.
Kiki
You're doing well, new guy. Will, was it?
Will
Yeah.
Thomas
She got you by the short hairs too?
Will
Huh?

Too?
Kiki
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Thomas
Truth is, we used to be jewelers.
Kiki
Of fake jewels, but yes.
Will
You were fraudsters?
Thomas
Put simply.
Kiki
Yeah, that's about right.
Will
And you got busted.
Thomas
We thought it would be a good idea to scam that Spencer guy.
Kiki
And he found us out right away. Said they weren't beautiful or whatever.
Thomas
We were about to lose our heads.
Will
And she asked to keep you two?
Kiki
That's the gist of it.
Will
I see.
Will
Are rehearsals always like this?
Thomas
Yep.
Kiki
Pretty much. It's just the leader going in circles and getting nowhere.
Will
...How long have you two been here?
Kiki
About half a year.
Thomas
Yeah, sounds about right.
Will
Maybe it's not my place to say, but why does this troupe even exist?
Will
There doesn't seem to be a single decent actor among us...
Will
Uh, err, not that I think I'm better than anyone. You two are a world apart from me.
Kiki
Aw, no need to worry. We all know we're terrible.
Thomas
The only reason we're all still here is because Spencer is the patron for this whole thing.
Kiki
Definitely. An actor of a theater troupe without a patron is as good as a vagrant.
Will
That sounds a little extreme.

When I say that, the two of them stop in their tracks.

They exchange a silent glance then look back at me as if I said the weirdest thing in the world.
Thomas
Will, you really know nothing about the theater, do you?
Kiki
But you write such good stuff. You've really never worked for another troupe?
Will
No, I...
Will
I usually run a pub. I've never been part of a troupe.
Kiki
What?!
Thomas
Really?!
Will
I do like writing, though.
Kiki
We won't think less of you, promise.
Thomas
You should leave right now and find a decent troupe to work for.
Will
But from what you say, I don't think I'm gonna have much luck elsewhere if my stuff isn't good enough to make it here.
Kiki
No, it's the other way around!
Thomas
Your writing's too good for this crummy band of nobodies. You stand out like a sore thumb.
Will
Oh.

Now I understand where they're going with this.

It seems like there isn't a single person in this troupe who cares about putting on a good play.

...Except for the leader, that is.

They probably just want to do the bare minimum in a situation they were forced into.

Just trying to keep a low profile and not call attention to themselves as they put up with being called slaves.

Is that the way to play it when it comes to this troupe?
Olivia
Will.
Will
What?
Olivia
There's still time before you have to open the pub, right? We're taking a detour. Follow me.
Will
Wait, where are we going?
Olivia
The Lily Theater.
Will
What?

Isn't that where Ed works?
Kiki
That's the base of the Admiral's Men.
Olivia
They're performing 'The Jew of Malta' today.
Will
Doesn't sound like it'll be very popular with a title like that.
Kiki
Don't be silly!
Thomas
Ever since it came out, Jewish characters have been popping up left and right in plays all over the city.
Olivia
The author is Christopher Marlowe.

Huh?

I feel like I've heard the name before.
Olivia
Right now, he's the number one playwright in all of Tenbridge.
Olivia
He's the person you must surpass.
Will
...

Yes, Ed mentioned that man.

The playwright who has become the best in Tenbridge with his violent, bloody stories.
Kiki
The bloke's a genius!
Thomas
Now I'd like to see someone write something better than Marlowe.
Olivia
Silence, slaves.
Kiki&Thomas
...
Olivia
Have anything to say?
Kiki&Thomas
Yes, Ma'am.
Will
But you just told them to be quiet...
Olivia
Let's go.

'The Jew of Malta' by Christopher Marlowe, performed by the Admiral's Men, consisted of five acts in total.

I could only describe the play as shocking and violent in nature.

The cheers of the audience poured in, and at the end, the playwright himself appeared on stage.
Will
Do all playwrights come out to greet the audience like that at the end?
Olivia
Only when the cheer merits it.
Olivia
When a play touches the hearts of an audience, they won't calm down until they see the playwright.
Olivia
Everyone loves a good poet.
Will
I see...

Deafening applause and cheers still fill the surrounding area as we exit the theater.
Olivia
Right now, the Admiral's Men are definitely the number one troupe in Tenbridge. Both in terms of popularity and talent.
Will
...
Olivia
Why so pensive?
Will
Uh...

The audience's reaction was staggering indeed.

And the acting was incredible.

However...
Will
I found the story rather... obtuse.
Olivia
How so?
Will
It's a revenge tragedy that doesn't shy away from depicting death, right? Its political backdrop and undertones are rather marked as well, so I somehow feel...
Will
If the play truly touched the audience's hearts, they couldn't possibly have reacted with such unbridled excitement, right?
Olivia
...
??
That's an interesting opinion.

A voice from behind surprises me, and I spin on my heels.
Will
Ah...

It's the man who came up onto the stage after the play.

It's...
Will
Christopher Marlowe...
Marlowe
Do you make a point of going around calling people by their full name?

The corners of Marlowe's mouth curl up into a fish-and-chips-eating grin before he lets out a petulant chuckle.
Marlowe
You saw my play, didn't you? It wasn't to your liking?
Will
Uh, I...
Marlowe
How about the beauty that accompanies you?

Olivia gives him a nonplussed smile.
Marlowe
Normally, I pay no attention to the comments of each and every audience member. They're worthless, and I hardly have the time.
Marlowe
But your words intrigue me ever so slightly.
Marlowe
Care to expand on your thoughts?
Will
No, uh, I was just talking out of my...

When I try to turn away from Marlowe, Olivia grips my sleeve.
Olivia
Don't run away.

Olivia whispers low enough for only me to hear.
Will
...

She's staring straight into my eyes.
Will
Is that an order?

She gives a swift nod.

I sigh in resignation and face Marlowe again.
Will
I thought it was a really stunning play. I think it's amazing how it could rouse people in such a way.
Marlowe
You propose that's because the audience was blind?
Will
I didn't say that...
Marlowe
Don't beat around the bush. You write too, don't you?
Will
...
Marlowe
Your sleeves are covered in ink.

I raise my hand out of reflex and notice black stains on the sleeve.
Marlowe
I'd like to hear the thoughts of a fellow writer. What is it that my plays lack in your eyes?

It's then that I realize...

A crowd is slowly forming around us.

Of course.

We're right in front of the Lily Theater.

This is his territory.
Marlowe
Hear, hear, all!

Suddenly, Marlowe spreads his arms wide in an exaggerated gesture and addresses the crowd around us.
Marlowe
This man here is a fellow playwright!
Marlowe
And it seems like today's play wasn't quite good enough for his discerning tastes!
Marlowe
I am asking for his reasoning to sustain this opinion right now. For future reference, of course.

He says, smirking at me all the while.

Olivia stands behind me, silent.

When I look back, I see her gaze is set firmly upon me.
Olivia
Speak your mind.

Olivia whispers behind me.

Why is she doing that?

I don't know her very well, but she's obviously not one to cower behind someone else if she has something to say.
Will
Is that another order?
Olivia
A suggestion, actually.

I sigh again, turn to Marlowe, and take a deep breath.
Will
I wouldn't say the play wasn't good. I just got the impression there was something inconsistent about it.
Marlowe
...
Will
It felt like different people wrote the first and second halves—
Marlowe
Interesting.

Marlowe rudely cuts me off.
Marlowe
So this means you see the people who cheered for tonight's play as a bunch of blind fools for enjoying what you call an inconsistent play.
Will
Don't put words in my mouth. The audience has no blame in this.
Will
I'm not pointing fingers at anyone.
Will
I know how easy it is to get swept up by emotion in a group.
Will
It's just that...
Will
When people get swept up by sensationalist elements and the essence of the piece doesn't touch anyone's heart...
Will
I think it's a pity, that's all.

Marlowe blinks at me in silence.
Marlowe
Did you hear that, everyone?

Abruptly, he turns to the audience.
Marlowe
This greenhorn playwright says that he pities each and every single person who saw us off with applause today.
Will
Hey! I didn't—

I try to speak up and stop Marlowe's bad faith rousing, but Olivia pulls me back.
Marlowe
I would have your name.
Marlowe
You have the obligation to give your name after directing such hostility at so many fair people.
Will
Wouldn't you like that...

He poisoned the well, and he's the one holding the reins of this conversation.

I can hear some people hollering already.
Will
I am...
Will
William Shakespeare. I'm the playwright for the Spencer troupe from the Globe Theater.
Marlowe
Globe Theater? Oh, I see now.
Marlowe
That troupe of amateurs, is it?

Laughter rises from around us.
Will
Yeah. Compared to you... to the Admiral's Men, they're a bunch of stale potatoes. I realize that.
Will
I don't think we can beat the quality of your actors, at least.

Marlowe raises an eyebrow sharply.
Marlowe
Just the actors?

I nod in response.
Marlowe
So you presume your scripts are better?
Will
I'd say so.

Sneers and shouts ring from around us.

I hear a lot of aggressive jeering.
Marlowe
You are quite interesting, William Shakespeare.
Marlowe
Shall we put it to the test?
Will
Huh?
Marlowe
Who shall be chosen to perform for the Royal Court?
Marlowe
There is no better way to decide who is better. You would not dare call the nobles of the court blind.
Will
...

What is this guy going on about?

The court led by Queen Elizabeth is made up of the blindest people in the land.
Will
I don't care about the nobles of the Royal Court.

Olivia stomps down on my foot.
Will
Ouch! What's your problem?!
Marlowe
Break your quill and cast it into the gutter, Shakespeare.
Will
Huh?!
Marlowe
England has no need of playwrights who desire not the honor of being selected to perform for the Royal Court.
Marlowe
Smooth talkers who would deride poets with a love for the written word have no right to hold a quill in their hands.
Will
The clothes are supposed to make the man, but so far all you well-dressed nobles have turned out to be rats!
Will
Can you stop manipulating every single damn thing in your favor?!
Marlowe
That's why I propose a fair contest. Let Queen Elizabeth, she who loves theater more than anyone else in this country, decide who is best.
Marlowe
You mean to say that you feel it is an insufficient stage to play out this feud?
Will
...

I'm sick of this.

And the worst part is that I know there's no way out.

The moment I gave my name, it was over.
Will
...All right.

The corners of Marlowe's lips curl up in a smirk.
Marlowe
The Admiral's Men and the Spencer troupe will fight for the nomination to perform for the Royal Court. The loser will put down the quill. For life.
Marlowe
I, Christopher Marlowe, playwright of The Admiral's Men, hereby swear to honor this agreement.
Will
I, William Shakespeare, playwright of the Spencer Troupe, swear as well. Is that good enough?
Will
All I gotta do is write a better script than you, right?
Marlowe
I'd say we've had enough fruitless arguing for one day. Let our words clash on the stage, as fellow bards.

Marlowe swiftly leaves the scene.

The spectators that had gathered around scatter quickly as well.

I'm already exhausted.
Will
Olivia.

She looks up at me.
Will
What is this Royal Court performance?

Olivia stops and stares at me.
Olivia
You are aware the queen enjoys theater, yes?
Will
Yeah.

We left the Lily Theater and went straight to open the pub.

As usual, no one was waiting for us to open.

It's just me, Dad, and Olivia at the counter.

For the first time, I thank the stars there's no one else around.
Olivia
She holds regular theater parties at the Royal Court that she participates in. They perform outdoors during summers, and mostly indoors during winter.
Olivia
There is no greater honor for a troupe in Tenbridge than being selected to perform for the Queen's pleasure.
Will
I see. So, who decides who gets the honor?
Olivia
I believe she has appointed people to go watch plays regularly and make recommendations to her.
Olivia
It's often the case that a play that has become the talk of the town ends up being selected by the Queen.
Will
She really likes theater, huh?
Olivia
It has been quite a while since the Queen chose a troupe.
Olivia
As things stand, it'll surely be a play written by that Marlowe man.
Will
That'd only make sense.
Olivia
Would it now? You do remember you swore to stop writing if that were to happen, yes?
Will
Yeah, and I obviously don't care for the man! But the truth is the truth!

She looks at me as if I said the stupidest thing ever.
Will
And why did you spur me on?! This happened because of you!
Olivia
What do you mean? Money couldn't buy this kind of publicity. I'm certain all who heard that little spat will be there to watch our performance.
Will
Really?
Olivia
No matter how excellent a script, or how well you act it out, it's all for naught if no one cares to watch you perform.
Will
I suppose there's no point arguing about it now. I could keep writing scripts under another pen name, I suppose.
Olivia
No.
Will
But that guy probably doesn't write all his scripts himself, I think. That means there must be ways to write anonymously.
Olivia
Banish those lowly standards from your mind. You are on a whole different level than Marlowe.
Olivia
And if your name garners attention, it'll help our chances of getting selected.
Will
Then how about you put your name on the line too?! This is your fight!
Olivia
Does everything I say go in one ear and out the other? The audience there watching you argue wasn't small. If they heard my voice, it would lead to the worst possible ending for both of us.
Will
...

People would recognize her on stage as a woman. Right.

I see now.
Olivia
Besides, a spat between bards will get people talking.
Will
You're pretty brave, you know. I admire you, truly I do.
Olivia
I'm an actress. We must be resilient.

Actress...

Did she come up with the word?
Olivia
And if we're elected to perform for the court, I...
Will
Mm?
Rob
Huh? Eh? Did we walk into the wrong pub?
Ed
My...
Will
Oh, welcome.
Father
Is that Rob and Ed I hear? Took you two long enough.
Ed
And who might this be?
Rob
Huh? Isn't that the lady who was with Spencer?
Will
It's a long story. Come on in.

Rob and Ed exchange looks before joining us at the bar.
Will
So, that's the story. We'll have to open the pub a little later from now on. I'm sorry if it's an inconvenience for you guys.
Rob
My lad, forget about that!
Ed
This cooking is quite delicious.
Rob
Yes! That's the important news!
Olivia
Naturally. I hope you came ready to pay.
Will
Olivia, surely you don't intend to treat all our customers with that attitude, do you?
Olivia
Is there a problem with it?
Will
Of course there is!
Father
Our customers seem quite happy with it, though?
Rob
Yeah, the little lady's easy on the eyes too.
Olivia
Who are you calling little lady, Rob? Do you want to leave here alive?
Ed
Yes, I can see a passionate following forming here now.
Olivia
You're one of the peddlers that visits the Spencer Manor, right?
Rob
Ah, you remember me?
Olivia
So you found this playwright by drinking here, huh?
Rob
Indeed I did, thank you.
Ed
So you are officially working with a troupe now, Will?
Rob
It's nice to see the apple falling far from the tree for once!
Father
What's that supposed to mean?! Knock him out, Will!
Will
Yeah, yeah, let's not start this again.
Father
Olivia, please deliver justice!
Rob
Ouch!
Will
Why did you hit him?! He's a customer!
Olivia
I was expressly told to hit this man.
Will
For all that's holy! You can't just hit people out of nowhere like that!
Will
They're not your slaves!
Father
Ahahahah! But you are her slave, ain't that right?
Ed
Slave?
Rob
Uh, is that some kind of kinky thing between you two?
Will
Please, let's not go there.
Olivia
I saved his life and now it belongs to me, as my slave.
Olivia
He tried to steal one of Spencer's deer and almost got his head cut off for his trouble.
Rob
What?! Lad, what the bloody hell were you thinking?!
Will
I don't think I was, sadly... As embarrassing as it is to admit, I had a major lapse in judgement.
Ed
Was it that night?

I nod.

Ed simply shakes his head.
Ed
I told you not to worry about the money.
Will
But I didn't steal anything, in the end.
Will
Just as Spencer was about to have my head cut off, Olivia bought me.
Olivia
That's why he's my slave.
Father
You are paying for your mistakes, my son.
Will
Yeah...
Father
Olivia, would you please hit him across the noggin for me?
Olivia
With pleasure, my good man.

For the love of... Whatever.
Father
No matter how hungry you are, you never take what is not yours. You get it now?
Will
I do, better than ever. I will never try to steal again in my life.
Rob
Well, let's not get all sour now. We were all young once. Didn't you have your fair share of mistakes too, Boss?
Father
Can't say I ever stole from anyone, no.
Rob
And in the end, Will didn't either, did he?! Can't move on if you start pointing fingers all over again.
Rob
You're writing plays for this lovely lady because you're atoning for your mistakes, right?
Will
I... suppose I am, yeah.
Olivia
You could use a little more backbone, I'd say.
Ed
You should work hard to make up for your past misdeeds. It'll be good for your soul.
Will
I know, thanks.
Olivia
You can start by working hard for the court performance.
Rob
As in the Royal Court? Our Will?!
Olivia
That's what we're aiming for. Although, if he can't even do that, I doubt he has much chance of atoning for those mistakes.
Rob
Hahah, you got yourself into a right mess, eh?
Will
It sure looks that way. The whole court thing started today, actually.
Ed
So you will be competing with the Admiral's Men from the Lily Theater, then.
Rob
The Admiral's Men? You mean against Marlowe?!
Olivia
Battle lines were drawn just a few hours ago. Whoever loses has to stop writing.
Rob&Ed
Whaaat?!
Rob
How reckless can you get?! You only just became a bonafide playwright, lad!
Will
It's not like I was looking for a fight, you know?
Olivia
If you're gonna compete, might as well make it flashy and attract an audience. It's exactly what we need.
Will
Or so she says.

Rob and Ed exchange another glance.
Rob
You've found a very, uh, eccentric master, huh?
Will
More like completely off her rocker.

After that, two first-time customers show up, and Olivia serves them.

Her haughty attitude turns out to be a huge hit among the men, so our sales for the day are double the usual.
Will
So...
Rob
Huh?
Will
I don't think I'm cut out for this bartender thing.
Rob
Eh?!
Rob
You only just realized?!
Father
That's news to nobody but you, ahahah!
Rob
Gotta say, the food's delicious today.
Will
Olivia made that too.
Ed
She's a member of the nobility, right?
Rob
Sure looks that way.
Ed
She's rather strange, isn't she?
Will
Aren't all nobles a bunch of oddballs?
Rob
In all my years, I've never seen a noble doing kitchen work.
Ed
The way she talks is new to me too.
Ed
Perhaps there's more to her than meets the eye.
Will
...

I watch Olivia talk to a customer sitting near the entrance.
Father
I feel more at ease with that lass around.

Rob and Ed nod at my father's words.
Will
...I've really been outdone, huh.

Late into the night, the new customers leave with a full bellies and red faces.

The only ones left are Rob and Ed.

I take sips of ale while washing the dishes.
Rob
So, you're gonna compete with that Marlowe guy? You got some kinda plan or something?
Will
Nope.
Rob
Even if you two were to both put out scripts of the same quality, I wager the audience would still pick Marlowe's over yours.
Ed
His name carries weight, and he's popular already.
Olivia
Write something overwhelmingly better than anything that joke of a man can produce. That's the plan.
Will
I don't think that's much of a plan.
Olivia
But we can't do much else, can we?
Rob
Indeed.
Will
...

Marlowe is the most popular playwright in Tenbridge.

On the other hand, I only started for real yesterday.

Is this even a competition?
Ed
It'll be fine, Will.

I turn to Ed.
Ed
As I said before, I've always believed that your writing has nothing to envy Marlowe's.
Olivia
Ed, was it? You like theater?
Ed
I work at the Lily Theater, so I watch the plays of the Admiral's Men daily.

Olivia nods, looking rather impressed.
Ed
When will the Royal Court selection take place?
Olivia
Two months, at the earliest.
Ed
So if you push it a little, you could put out three plays in that time.
Olivia
Yes.
Ed
Will may be the one writing, but you have Rob to back you up, and I can always give advice if you need it. You're not in this fight alone.
Ed
You will succeed.
Will
Thanks, Ed.
Rob
He's damn right! I'll go load up on as many rumors as I can.
Olivia
The problem now is your acting prowess, or the lack of it.
Rob
Huh? You're acting too?!
Will
...
Father
Huh, what role?
Olivia
The main character. A female role.
Rob
Ahahahah!
Father
Fits him like a glove! Come on, show us what you can do!
Will
No, thanks.
Ed
Well, it's not like actual women can play the female roles, so they usually go to handsome men like Will.
Will
...

I steal a glance at Olivia.

She's nodding at Ed's words with a pleasant smile on her face.

She really is an actress, huh?
Father
Oh, what I'd give to see my son crossdressing with my own two eyes.
Will
Ah, shut up!

After Rob and Ed leave and my dad goes back upstairs, Olivia and I are left cleaning the pub.

It was my first time working together with someone since I started manning the counter, and it really made things a lot easier than being alone.
Will
Thanks for the help.
Olivia
Huh?
Will
I just...
Olivia
I don't need your gratitude. All you have to do is let me read the best scripts the world has ever seen.
Will
I knew you'd say something like that.
Olivia
Then why are you bothering me?
Will
Good question...
Will
I think I needed to thank you, despite everything.

Olivia stops scrubbing the table and stares at me.
Olivia
Must be the bard in you talking.
Olivia
Well then, see you tomorrow.
Will
You'll come tomorrow as well?
Olivia
How impossibly foolish can you get? Just helping you for a day wouldn't solve a thing, would it?
Olivia
Unlike you, half-hearted isn't in my vocabulary.
Olivia
Bye.

Olivia walks to the door.
Will
Olivia.

She looks back at me.

Her white hair fans out and sways as she goes.
Will
...Thanks.
Olivia
How many times must I—
Will
Yes, all I need to do is write, I know.
Will
Still, thanks.
Olivia
...

She leaves without saying another word.

I smile, despite myself.

...

It feels like a storm is brewing in my chest.

What is this feeling?

I'm just doing what I need to fulfill my purpose, my ambition.

But...

That place feels comfortable and warm.

I feel like I understand why he's trying so desperately to protect that little house.

...

All the members of the troupe are mere tools to me.

Not a single one of them is motivated to do more than they need to.

That's why I treat them as such. Tools to further my goals.

Words of gratitude like his...

How many years has it been since anyone has spoken such words to me?

I want to go back tomorrow as well.

It's cramped, the water is cold, and the ingredient selection is paltry at best.

But it trumps Spencer's manor.

*Sigh* I don't need these silly thoughts. Not now.

The more I enjoy my time there, the harder it becomes to go back to the estate.
Olivia
A little too late, isn't it?

I take another sluggish step on my way back to that huge, hollow mansion.
