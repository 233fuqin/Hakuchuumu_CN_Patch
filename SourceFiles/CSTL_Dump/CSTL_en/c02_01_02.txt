Will
Haah...

I trudge down the stairs, my steps a little unsteady after working all night.
Will
Morning.
Father
Morning, Son.

I find my dad peeling potatoes in his usual spot.

This is one of the few tasks that he's still able to do since he lost his sight.

Moving behind the counter, I see the meal I prepared last night still untouched.
Will
You're not eating?
Father
I could go for a drink.
Will
Don't be grumpy now.

He lets out a throaty laugh.
Will
You can rest. There's a gathering today, so there's no need to tire yourself out.
Father
Don't worry. All I do is sit around and be a nuisance when the patrons come.
Will
You make double the racket than all our patrons combined.
Father
That's just how I pass the time. Don't you worry.
Will
...
Father
Yeah, I could go for a drink.
Will
You know I can't let you drink. Don't be stubborn.

His smile turns bitter as he continues peeling.

Now that I think about it, when was the last time I saw him eat anything?

It must have been about four days ago.

He nibbles on apples, and munches on nuts from time to time, but it's been that long since I saw him have a proper meal.

It was when I was restocking our ale supplies, if I remember correctly.

I glance at him again.

He's looking a little worse for wear every morning.
Townsfolk
Public execution! At the fountain square!

We hear someone shouting outside.

With it comes the hullabaloo of people moving in one direction and shouting.
Father
Catholic hunting, eh?
Will
Looks like it.

I stare at the door for a moment then turn to him.
Will
Should we go?
Father
No...
Father
Not like I can see it with my own two eyes.
Will
All right.

Ever since Queen Elizabeth's coronation, the persecution of Catholics has intensified.

Being or even housing a believer is grounds for execution.

After pulling on the limbs of those poor souls until their tendons snap, they are exposed naked in front of all, and their intestines gutted to make a display out of them.

After that their head is severed from their bodies and put on a stake to adorn the castle for several days.

It has become something of a source of entertainment among the common folk.

This country has lost its freedom of creed.

I'm repulsed every time I see a portrait of the queen as I go about the city.

I wish she were made to experience the same pain and humiliation that is being inflicted upon others under her rule.

We stay there in silence, the pile of peeled potatoes growing larger.
Will
So, what are your plans for today?
Father
Same as always.

I answer with a nod.
Father
Will.

I look up at him.
Father
Sorry, I need to go upstairs for a bit.
Will
All right.
Will
I'll come with you.

I slowly climb up the stairs after him.

We enter the largest room of the house, and my dad sits at one of the tables in the middle of it.
Will
You're praying, right?
Father
Yeah.
Will
All right.

I turn over a small painting on the wall, showing the image of the crucifix on the back.

This cross is a symbol of the Catholic faith.

If this idol were to be found, we'd be subject to capital punishment as well.

And yet, I somehow feel closer to God with such things around.

A person's faith cannot be fettered.

That was my father's steadfast belief when he set up this room as a secret meeting place for believers.

This is another facet of the pub we run together.

I walk behind my kneeling father and cross myself.

Then I clasp my hands together and join him in silent prayer.

We humans are weak.

We need something to support our fallible hearts, to draw strength from in hopeless times.

After a while, I open my eyes.

My father is still kneeling in front of me.

After staring at his back for a moment, I leave the room.

I go back downstairs and continue peeling potatoes.

The hustle and bustle outside doesn't abate.

I keep working, trying to put the horrific event going on outside out of my mind.
Rob
Hey.
Will
Hey there.

We exchange knowing glances, and I nod.

If I'm familiar with someone, I don't need to ask for the password.

There's are just under ten people who regularly attend these gatherings.

We rarely get new faces.

With the persecution going on, it's no wonder.

Public executions have become a new source of entertainment for the people.

After Rob, a few more familiar faces come in and go upstairs.

All of them wear grim expressions.
Ed
Will.
Will
Hey, Ed.

Ed smiles at me.
Ed
Is everyone inside?
Will
Yeah.

His expression softens a little.
Ed
Would you like to join us today?
Will
There'll be no one to keep officers from snooping around if I'm up there too.
Ed
They're all manning their spectacle over at the square.

I look down at the potatoes.
Ed
Let us all pray together. If those that are left behind don't pray with all their hearts...
Ed
...those suffering in the square won't find peace with the Lord.

He stares at me, conviction steeling his words.

I can see the fire of dissent in his eyes. A quiet, strong glow that yields not to the times we're living in.
Will
All right, Father.

I put the knife down and wash my hands.

Ed smiles kindly and goes upstairs.

I follow after him.

When I enter the room, Ed walks up to the front.

Less than ten believers are gathered around Rob and my dad.

Ed stands in front of everyone.

All turn their attention to him.

Everyone looks as grave as a tomb.

It's only natural, of course.

Believers just like us have been executed for simply offering prayers while trying to escape Queen Elizabeth's persecution.

Hiding believers, not to mention a priest, is a crime punishable by death.

I don't know under what charges today's execution is being carried out.

But I'm certain they couldn't have committed anything so atrocious as to warrant being slaughtered in front of a rabid crowd.

I'm sure everyone else here thinks the same.

Ed surveys the group.
Ed
The times are changing, and the world along with it.

He starts talking in a clear, measured tone.
Ed
We may needs to hide our faith and sneak like thieves in the night, but a pastor never leaves his flock unattended. I am certain that, in time,  a wise, fair ruler who understands the holy spirit will come to guide men and women alike.
Ed
We must weather this storm.
Ed
Our steadfast perseverance will surely pave the way for those who come after us.

Ed's expression is calm, but his voice has a strength of will that makes the air in the room shiver.

His poise makes me realize that I could never make it as a priest.

I can't forgive this oppression.

I can't smile in the face of adversity like he does.

I want to see those who do these awful things pay.

...Maybe this is why everyone flocks to Ed.

His smile is our salvation in these trying times. It's a rock in the desert.

Ed places his hand atop the Bible and closes his eyes in prayer.

Everyone else does the same.

When Ed's sermon ends, we all leave the little hall.

We always go down to the pub afterwards to eat together.

Everyone looks cheerier now.

I'm sure the pub's atmosphere is helping to ease their minds.

This is exactly what the pub is for.

I love to stand behind the counter and watch everyone having a good time.

Even my dad is smiling.

The good times keep rolling, and one by one, people leave a little happier than they came.

In the end it's only Rob, Ed, Dad, and me.

The usual suspects.

The ale keeps flowing, and so does time.
Rob
I'm glad we have this place.

Rob mutters, taking a sip from his cup.
Rob
If it weren't for this here pub, I'm sure I would have lost it long ago.
Ed
Being able to recognize your own weakness is the first step to forgiving weakness in others.
Rob
...
Ed
Perhaps faith itself was born out of our weakness.
Rob
Maybe, yeah.

Rob stares at the ale swaying inside his cup for a while, then takes the last swig.
Father
Why, perhaps ale was born because of our weakness as well.
Will
What?
Father
In other words, it would be morally right to let your old man wet his lips in these trying times.
Ed
I feel like that's a bit of a leap of logic.
Father
Oh, you think so?
Will
Yeah, you old coot. How many times do I need to tell you to give it a rest?
Father
Just one cup, please!
Ed
One becomes two, which in turn becomes three. Then you lose count.
Will
He who has eyes, let them see.
Father
Ah, shut it! You sticks in the mud!
Will
Who's the parent and who's the child here?
Rob
Oi, lad. How's the script coming along?
Will
Well enough. I pulled out one of my rough drafts and I'm fixing it up.
Rob
Huh? Not using the story of the king from yesterday?
Will
I can't get that done in two days.
Ed
What is this story you're working on about then?
Will
I'm basing it on a story Rob supposedly heard in Italy.
Rob
Italy? Me? When did I tell this story, lad?
Will
About four years ago.
Ed
So this was when I wasn't in Tenbridge, then.

As a priest, he moves towns regularly.

Staying in one place for too long attracts the attention of the Queen's men.

If memory serves right, he should be setting out for a new city this summer.

We'll miss him, but there are more Catholics all over the country who need the encouraging message of a priest like him.
Father
Four years, eh? So around the time you started manning the counter.
Rob
Can't say I remember. What story was that?
Will
You know, the one about the letter. The one that got switched.
Rob
A letter? Ah!
Rob
Yes! I remember now! Hahah, that was a good one, all right!
Ed
I think I've had enough suspense for an evening. What story is this?
Rob
Let me tell you. It was a bit of hearsay that reached my ears over in Italy.
Will
A rumor, you mean.
Father
Rob has a lot of those.
Rob
So it's a story about this beautiful lass and this handsome lad in Rome. They exchanged letters for over a year.
Ed
Mhm.
Rob
They spun poems and vows of love through the written word, fanning the flames of their love despite not having ever heard one another's voice.
Ed
But they had seen each other, I assume?
Rob
Not quite. Their beauty was famed throughout the city. That's not the whole story, though.

Rob leans forward.
Rob
Their letters were always delivered by a certain boy. This boy delivered their letters to another party.
Ed
Oh?
Rob
To another pair of lovebirds that shared the same name as them.
Will
In other words, two different men were exchanging letters with two different women.
Father
For a whole year?!
Will
Pretty intriguing, isn't it?
Rob
It all started when the boy delivered the first letter from the man to the wrong lass. But by the time he noticed, it was too late. The woman was beside herself with joy after reading the letter.
Rob
And that's how they began to exchange letters with the wrong person. Oh, how easy it would have been to correct his mistake early on.
Rob
But the boy racked his brains to find a way to make things work. And thus, he delivered the woman's letters to another party as well.
Ed
Oho.
Rob
Any town is full of men looking to bag themselves such a beauty, so the boy found a man with the same name as the original handsome lad, and delivered the letter.
Ed
So a new exchange was created.
Rob
He figured they'd stop soon enough, and that'd be it. He could never have predicted that all four of them would develop such a passion for poems and exchanging vows of love.
Will
An unwilling cupid, if you will.
Rob
Quite.
Ed
So they're sharing correspondence with the wrong person for over a year... We're talking about a comedy, I assume.
Will
It's a tragedy, in a sense.
Rob
The man the boy found was married.
Ed
The plot thickens!
Father
This is no good. No good at all.
Rob
With the roaring flames of love burning in his heart, the man decides to abandon his family and elope with this girl!
Ed
And then?
Rob
And then...
Ed
Go on.
Rob
That's all I heard.
Ed
What?!
Father
Why?!
Rob
Because it was hearsay, my good men.
Will
The punchline in Rob's stories shines for its absence more often than not.
Ed
Wonder what happened to them in the end.
Rob
Remember this is all rumor. It's already up for debate whether any of this really happened.
Will
Don't break the mystique, would you?
Rob
It's true that I heard about it, that I assure you!
Ed
No one's doubting you on that front.
Rob
So, what are you doing with this story?
Will
The crux of this story is the burning passion these people develop for the wrong person, right?
Will
One of them even abandons his family to try and live out this fantasy of pure love.
Rob
I guess any man could relate.
Will
Yeah, a lot of people can relate to dreaming of a better life. It's a simple, universal concept.
Ed
But this a play, isn't it?
Rob
Sounds boring if the whole thing is just a back and forth between letters.
Will
Even if it takes a year for love to develop in real life, you only need three lines in a play.
Rob
Just three?
Will
With the help of magic, for example.
Ed
I see.
Rob
So, what, the kid uses magic or something?
Will
What if the little miscreant who mixed up the letters was a fairy instead?
Ed
A fairy, you say?
Will
You have a pair of women and men.
Will
And they end up falling for the wrong person thanks to the mischief of a little fairy.
Rob
Huh, that doesn't sound half bad.
Will
I'm framing it as a comedy to make people laugh and leave the theater with a smile on their faces.
Will
And I'm planning for a happy end where, after the whole mess, everyone ends up with the right person.
Ed
So this boy turned fairy assumes the role of a jester, then.
Rob
Sounds good! You're a genius, lad!
Will
I quite like writing, and I actually enjoy coming up with stories.
Will
But you're always hurrying me!
Rob
Still, it looks like you won't disappoint this time either!
Will
I'm not having an easy time, you know?!
Will
I gotta think about what to do with that fairy angle and there aren't enough characters to fill in the time.
Ed
I'd say you're doing remarkably well. No playwright in the Lily Theater could work as fast as you.
Rob
Speaking of the Lily Theater playwrights...
Ed
Notably, Christopher Marlowe, yes.
Rob
That'd be Tenbridge's most popular playwright, yeah?
Ed
But Will is faster, and his stories strike me as having more depth.

Ed turns to me.
Ed
You can win, my boy.
Will
You think so?
Rob
Set your sights high! All right! I have just the thing to put some pep in your step!
Will
Huh?
Rob
Eheheh, it'll knock your socks right off.
Ed
Mm?

Rob rummages in his bag and produces a bit of something deep red in color.
Will
Jerky?
Rob
Not just any jerky, my lad.
Ed
Is that... venison?
Rob
You bet!
Father
Oooh!
Will
That's really fancy, isn't it?
Father
Fancy? Lad, that's a luxury.
Rob
Get yerself a deer and sell all the meat off its bones, and I reckon you'd make three month's worth of the pub's earnings in one day.
Will
Three months for just one deer? It's that expensive?

I knew it was a luxury food, but goodness.

Three months? That's just ludicrous.

...Where can I even find deer?
Rob
Heheh, a gift from your most valued customers.
Will
Whoa, really?
Rob
That Spencer guy keeps deer the way one would dogs.
Will
Oh, I see now.

He keeps those expensive animals as pets?
Rob
I'm just sharing what I was so graciously given.
Ed
Money certainly holds a different value to those nobles.
Rob
Let's eat it together. I don't feel like eating alone today.

His tone sinks like a rock in water.

Perhaps he's remembering the ghastly sight of those in the square today.
Rob
Gotta eat to live, eh? Here, Will.
Will
Thanks.

I tear off a bite of the jerky.

Ed follows suit, as does Rob.
Rob
Have some, Boss. It's venison. None of us see this often.
Father
I've never had it before.
Ed
Go right ahead.

Ed speaks around a mouthful.

I break off a bit of the meat and put it on my dad's palm.

He carefully picks it up between two fingers and slowly brings it to his mouth.
Father
Well, don't mind if I do.

After a bit of chewing, he opens his unseeing eyes wide.
Father
Hmm, this is rather good.
Rob
I hear it's good for you. Eat up, old man. You've been getting thinner, and don't think I haven't noticed.
Father
You've been telling them, Will? Don't burden the customers with stuff like that.
Will
If you eat, I won't have to. No more ale for you.
Father
Like hell! I'll drink in my grave!

It's late at night, and Ed is the first to leave.

Right after that, Rob gets up from his seat as well.
Rob
Well, Bard. I leave the script writing to you. Have it to me by tomorrow, as we agreed.
Will
Yeah, got it.
Rob
I'm looking forward to reading it meself.
Will
Say, Rob.
Rob
Huh?
Will
Do you think I could get more work writing plays?
Rob
...Money troubles?

I nod.
Rob
Hmm... You know it's no jest when I say that there's people eternally lined up in front of the theater in the hopes of becoming playwrights.
Rob
The deadlines I give you are always so tight because they don't come knocking on my door unless some kind of problem popped up.
Will
Yeah, I know.
Rob
I suppose you could get picked up as a regular playwright in some theater if you keep doing good work, but you can't just abandon your main job here.
Will
Yeah.
Rob
It's a hard selI, I must admit. They won't take scripts from a peddler like me unless it's some kind of emergency.
Will
I see...
Rob
Sorry, my lad. I'll make up for it by giving you good business.
Will
Thanks, Rob.
Rob
I know you're having it rough, lad.
Will
Not so much. I have loyal clients that eat the crap I put on their plates, and I get to hear lots of stories.
Will
I'm living a good life.
Rob
That so? Heheh. I'll come buy out that crappy food so you guys don't go under.
Will
You're gonna have a huge pot belly by the end.
Rob
Hahah... Sorry for not being able to help. I could be your patron if only I was one of those nobles.
Will
Don't apologize, you do a lot for us.
Rob
It's been a long day.

Rob looks up at the night sky out the window.
Will
Sure has.
Rob
I wonder how long this will keep going on.
Will
There's no evil that lasts a hundred years, nor a body that can endure it.

He turns back to me.
Will
That's something Ed once told me.

He laughs heartily.
Rob
Everyone's a poet now. I see how it is.
Will
All the world's a stage.

He nods in response.
Rob
Make sure you put some of that literary fire in the script, will you?
Rob
I'm counting on you, Bard.
Will
No pressure or anything...
