When I stand up, Yonagi does the same.
Kaito
You're coming with me?
Yonagi
...

She nods.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
...

Yonagi trails after me without saying a word.

Her bare feet slap against the floor.
Kaito
Hey, Yonagi.

I turn back and call out to her, which elicits no response from her.
Kaito
I mean, can I call you Yonagi?
Kaito
Do you remember how long we have been here?
Kaito
...

No response.
Kaito
Figures.

I face ahead again and go to the elevator leading up to the rooftop.

The elevator door opens in front of us.

A cool air blows onto our faces as it does.

When I move to step outside...
Yonagi
...

Yonagi stops me, pulling on my sleeve.
Kaito
You don't wanna go?

She shakes her head.
Yonagi
*Cough*

She lets out a cough.

Right, the air outside is pretty dusty.

Tokyo is an underground city.

The air is cleaner indoors.
Kaito
Then let's go back.
Yonagi
...

She bobs her head.

Yonagi stays a few steps behind me as we walk down the corridor to our room.

Once we arrive, she heads straight for her bed.
Kaito
Do you feel better in here?
Yonagi
...

No reaction.

Maybe she just doesn't feel like talking.
Kaito
Do you have dreams too?
Kaito
...
Kaito
What kind of dreams?
Kaito
...
Kaito
...
Yonagi
...

She just yawns in response.
Kaito
Are you sleepy?

Instead of answering my question, she lays down on the bed.

She keeps her rose eyes trained on me.
Kaito
...

Hearing the door open behind me, I turn back to see Izumo and Wooleep come into the room.
Izumo
Kaito, do you want to take a shower?
Kaito
A shower?

She nods.
Kaito
...

I lift up my arm and take a whiff.

Thankfully, it doesn't smell.

But perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to take a shower before the next dream.
Kaito
Yeah, I guess that'd be nice.
Izumo
Here.

Izumo presents me with a neatly folded set of clothes.

They're exactly the same I'm wearing now.
Kaito
Is she gonna be okay on her own?
Izumo
The shower booth is for one person. You can't bathe together.
Kaito
That's not what I'm talking about.
Izumo
...
Yonagi
...

Izumo and Yonagi just stare at me silently.

...This is so uncomfortable.
Kaito
Whatever, I'll just go take a shower.
Izumo
Go ahead.
Kaito
...

I get up and head to the door.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
Yeah, thanks.

Wooleep chirps at me when I pass him. For some reason, I construe it as him calling out to me, so I thank him out of some kind of reflex.
Yonagi
...

When I come back from the shower, Yonagi's already asleep.

I go to my bed, sit down, and stare at her for a moment.

She's turned over with her back to me.
Kaito
...

I lay down on the bed, facing the stark white ceiling.

This is a weird place.

A weird place, full of weird girls.

I blink slowly.

My eyelids feel heavy, and opening them back up is feeling like a worse proposition by the minute.

This warmth makes me feel really sleepy.

Izumo said that these dreams are sequenced like stories.

Will I see the continuation of that last dream now?

As my hazy mind vaguely wonders about these dream world memories, I fall into a deep sleep.
