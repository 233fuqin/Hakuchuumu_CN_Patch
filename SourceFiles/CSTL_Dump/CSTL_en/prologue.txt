Kaito
People make people.
Kaito
That which we call individuality is but the collection of memories each of us makes throughout our lives.
Kaito
When it’s time to make a judgment, we use our past experiences as guidelines to lead us.
Kaito
And those judgments lead to the actions we take. That’s why...
Kaito
Our past experiences—our memories inform our words and deeds.

The briny breeze brushes against my cheek.

In front of the small, seaside cabin.

The warm sea breeze envelops all the people gathered there.
Kaito
We are creatures that make our assumptions of a person based on their actions.
Kaito
And thus, we indirectly see the result of other’s memories and perceive them as individuals.
Kaito
That chain of perception is what makes up this world.

I raise my face and look over the crowd.

All their eyes are gathered on me.

Then, I slowly close my eyes.

I always do the same before telling the story.

The sound of the waves fills my mind.

I take a deep breath and take in the scent of the calm tides.

And behind my closed eyes, a girl comes into view.

She’s here today too.

She’s always there, inside of me.

After taking valor from her presence, I slowly open by eyes.
Kaito
That chain of perception is what makes this world.
Kaito
The world I see, and the world you all see. It’s all formed by the common perception of all that live in it. We all form that huge link holding us together.

I turn my face to a boy sitting in the front row.
Kaito
You can see the sea right behind me, can you?

I say, looking straight into his eyes.

The boy gives me a small, sheepish nod.
Kaito
Do you think it’s beautiful?

Again, he nods.
Kaito
That clear blue sea that blurs in the horizon and melts into the sky. What wills those waves is the common ideals of everyone in this world.
Kaito
The sea that everyone around the world dreams about... That is what you’re seeing right now. That’s why it’s so beautiful.

The boys stares at me for a moment before nodding again.
Kaito
I’m about to tell you the story of one girl.
Kaito
A story I tell to every person that comes here.
Kaito
That is the my duty, and the reason I am here.
Kaito
I want to tell you the story of the one that taught me what life is.
Kaito
The one who taught me that I can decide for myself even while bound by other’s perception.
Kaito
The story of a lone girl.
Kaito
Her name was Yonagi.
Kaito
What I’m about to tell you is...
Kaito
...the story of the girl who dreamed the world.
