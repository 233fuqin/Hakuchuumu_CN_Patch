Rin
Hey.
Arishima
...

I hear someone call me from behind and turn to face them.
Rin
You like books, don't you, Arishima?
Arishima
I suppose I don't hate them.
Rin
I like them too. What are you reading there?
Arishima
A novel.
Rin
Is it good?
Arishima
Yeah, I like this person's writing.
Arishima
I wouldn't call it interesting, though.
Rin
Mmh...

Hatano exhales a soft breath as she looks at the novel I'm holding.
Rin
Mind if I borrow it when you're done?
Arishima
Huh?

She's staring into my eyes.
Arishima
Uh, sure thing. You can have it.

I put the novel down on the table.

She opens her eyes wide.
Rin
Are you sure?
Arishima
I've read it a bunch of times. Take it.

She bashfully picks it up.
Rin
Thanks.

I nod.
Rin
So you want to write too, then?
Arishima
What?
Rin
You can write.
Arishima
...

I stare at her and shake my head.

She quirks a wide, sly smile.
Rin
You want to write so badly.
Rin
You know you can.
Arishima
No. It didn't work.
Arishima
When I tried, all I wrote was trash. Reading other people's prose isn't enough to teach you how to string together your own sentences.
Arishima
...I couldn't write.
Shouko
It's not that you couldn't. You just didn't.

Hatano looks up at the source of the voice.

It's my wife, standing between us.
Shouko
And while you sat there not writing, at some point you really stopped being able to, didn't you?
Shouko
How nice it must have felt to be unable to write. A load off your shoulders.
Shouko
Because of course, it's not your fault. Time is to blame, isn't it? It's never you.

Rin stares at my wife.
Arishima
...Don't say that in front of the students.

My wife laughs, contempt and disdain seeping into the sound.

Rin's eyes are locked on her, her expression unchanged.

My wife disappears.

She's nowhere to be seen anymore.

Rin stares at the spot where she was for a long moment.

I turn my gaze back to her.

She does the same, and we stare at each other in silence.
