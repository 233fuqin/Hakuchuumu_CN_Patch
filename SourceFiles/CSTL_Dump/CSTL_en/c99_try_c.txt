Sumomo's memory lingers in my mind.

That joyful smile of hers.

I'm certain that it's as much Yonagi's happiness as it is Sumomo's.

In both this world—

And the dream world—

I'm the only one who can bring out that smile.

I'm sure Yonagi's smile can be as dazzling as Sumomo's.

I clench my fists, a mixture of determination and conviction filling my being.
