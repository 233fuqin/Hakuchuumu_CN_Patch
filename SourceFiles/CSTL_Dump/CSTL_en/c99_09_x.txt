Kaito
Yonagi?
Yonagi
I'm sleepy...

I look around the room.

I scan for a clock, which reminds me...

At least in the areas we can move freely through, there are no clocks.

But I think Yonagi has been focused on playing for a long while.
Kaito
Wanna go to bed?
Yonagi
Mhm...
Kaito
Let's go, then. Can you walk?

Yonagi nods.

But she can't quite seem to get to her feet.

I lend Yonagi a hand and help her up. Then, keeping hold of her hand, I lead her back to our room.

I manage to get her back to the bedroom before she passes out completely.

Then I have her lay down in her bed.

But when I try to let go of her hand, she holds on.
Kaito
Yonagi?
Yonagi
Kaito...

We left the still, cold bird in the hole we dug in our secret spot.

This is where the bird and Mommy are sleeping together.

Kaito and I decided...

That it's not sad.

Mommy and the bird are only having a peaceful sleep.

But still...

I can't stop the tears from coming out.
Kaito
Ah!

When I come to, I find myself back in the white room.
Kaito
That was... Yonagi?
Yonagi
...
Kaito
...

Yonagi already seems to be sleeping peacefully.
Kaito
What was that?

I lay back down in bed, recalling what felt like a video feed being broadcast directly into my head.

After staring at the ceiling for a while, I turn to face Yonagi.

She's lying on her back, sleeping undisturbed.
Kaito
...

That was different from Yonagi's dream world.

Was it a real memory from this world?

I close my eyes and think, but my focus starts to dim before long.

Soon, my consciousness fades away completely.
