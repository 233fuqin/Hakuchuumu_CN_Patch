Sumomo
And then, we came here to this apartment.
Sumomo
That was out first time, huh?
Azuki
Yeah, I didn't need to hear that! I could figure that out for myself! You obviously didn't come here to play video games!
Sumomo
Ahahah!
Kanna
I still remember it like it was yesterday. Can't believe it's been two years since then.
Azuki
So next you're gonna be tying the knot and living happily ever after?

Beaming, Sumomo nods.

I nod as well.
Azuki
Man, it's still kinda hard for me to wrap my head around.
Azuki
I mean, back then you were a student, and she was your teacher, right?
Sumomo
I was in training! I was still a student. You're the one who was way older than both of us!
Azuki
Oh, cut the crap!
Kanna
I never expected things to turn out like this either.
Kanna
Neither did Sumomo, did you?
Sumomo
I guess not. Back then, I was really worried about you being younger.
Sumomo
Now it's no big deal, but back when you were a student it was kind of iffy.
Azuki
Who cares?! Age is just a number, isn't it?!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're sooo desperate.
Azuki
Am not!

The good times keep rolling, and so does time itself.

By now, the only thing left in the bottom of the pot is hardened grease.
Sumomo
Are you staying the night, Azuki?
Azuki
Eh? Is that the time already?
Sumomo
Wait, you're driving, right? You sure you should be drinking?
Azuki
It's all good.

She takes car keys out of her pocket.

I recognize them right away.

They're for Hachimaru.
Azuki
I wanna give this back.

Her voice is quiet.

I stare blankly at her for a moment.
Kanna
Uh, why? It's yours.
Azuki
You gave the Hachimaru to me because you thought your ma would be happier if I were driving it around, right?
Azuki
But the situation's different now. When you and Peach make some babies, you gotta take the little buggers camping!
Azuki
I bet that's make your ma even happier.

Azuki flashes me a confident, reassuring grin.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
But weren't you living in the car?
Azuki
I've saved up more than enough money. It's about time I look for a place to settle down.
Azuki
I'm not getting any younger.
Sumomo
You still got plenty left in you! You're gorgeous! Those young models got nothing on you.
Azuki
It's fine. I've never been out to compete with anyone.
Kanna
But...
Azuki
I've kept it well maintained. It might look the same, but that car's sturdier than it's ever been. Besides...
Azuki
We have phones now. If anything happens, give your personal scrap hunter a call and she'll be there in a flash to fix you right up.
Kanna
...
Azuki
It's my wedding gift. Take it, Candy.
Kanna
...Thanks.
Sumomo
Yeah, thank you. You're the coolest lady in the whole wide world!
Azuki
Heh, that's a given.

After accompanying Azuki to the nearest train station, we go to the parking lot Hachimaru's parked in and get in.
Sumomo
Whoa! What a blast from the past!
Kanna
It hasn't changed at all.
Sumomo
Hey, sooo...

Sumomo puts her hand on mine.
Sumomo
Do you remember? We slept together here back then.
Kanna
I do.

Sumomo leans in closer and whispers into my ear.
Sumomo
Wanna take a wink again? Well, I suppose we don't need to hold ourselves back anymore.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Getting shy?
Kanna
Not particularly.
Sumomo
Aw, Come on.

We huddle up together in the narrow sleeping space the Hachimaru gives.
Sumomo
Man, now this brings back memories!
Kanna
You can say that again.
Sumomo
Hey, think you could take the weekend off? We should go on a camping trip!
Kanna
Sounds good to me. Consider my weekend free.
Sumomo
Cool! You can be my exclusive weekend cameraman.

I nod, a placid smile setting on my face.
Sumomo
Now that I think about it, it'll be our first time camping out just the two of us.
Kanna
Yeah, I think so.
Sumomo
It's gonna be so much fun!

I reach out for her head.

She simply closes her eyes as she enjoys the feeling of me stroking her hair.
Sumomo
Kanna.
Kanna
Yes?
Sumomo
I'm super happy. Just knowing I get to spend all my days together with you like this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
Kanna
Me too.
Kanna
Every moment with you is the most fun I've ever had.
Sumomo
Let's make lots of babies and stay together until we're both old and wrinkly.
Kanna
There's nowhere I would rather be.
Sumomo
But make sure you don't die before me. I'd miss you horribly.
Kanna
No way. I don't wanna live without you either.
Sumomo
Ahahah! We're both dummies in love, huh?
Kanna
That's okay by me.
Sumomo
Yeah. I like being a dummy a lot. I'm so glad I was never the brightest tool in the shed.
Sumomo
When we have kids, let's bring them up well, okay?
Kanna
Hmm... You think I'll end up like my dad?
Sumomo
Ahahah! I bet you will!
Kanna
...

All of a sudden...

Memories of Mom, indomitable as storm, and of Dad, a serious man of few words, fill my mind.

I wonder if we'll become a married couple like they were.

Now wouldn't that be something.
