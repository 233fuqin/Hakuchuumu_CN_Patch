Everyone
*Sigh*
Will
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of your presence today?

It's been two weeks since Olivia and I said goodbye.

After that single performance of Romeo and Juliet we put on for the Queen and her court...

Someone must have leaked information about it, because rumors about my new play started running rampant around the city.

Rumors about a great masterpiece of theater, performed at a secret event held by Queen Elizabeth herself.

The attention of all theater goers in the city is now set upon the next play of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. That would be us.

I only open the pub about once a week these days.

To be honest, I'm so busy with rehearsals and writing new plays that I barely have time to open up and serve drinks.

Now I only open for the benefit of people like Rob who have always stuck with us. It's not about the profit anymore.

I only opened today because they all begged me to do so, so I spent the whole morning peeling potatoes in preparation.
Will
Why the long faces, guys? Is this not what you wanted?
Rob
This is so insipid...
Kiki
You didn't even cook this properly.
Thomas
Mine had a lump of salt in it.
Father
I want ale.
Will
You shut up, you old coot!
Father
What was that?!
Will
You know this is how my cooking has always been!
Will
But you still pester me at least once a week about your damn ale! I spent all night writing a script and got basically no sleep, only to wake up and spend all day peeling damn potatoes for you!
Will
That's why the seasoning is off and your food is half cooked! You all asked for this! Now eat!
Rob
I see none of that writing talent has trickled down anywhere else.
Kiki
It's actually amazing how he hasn't improved one bit.
Father
I miss Olivia's porridge, and the ale.
Will
You want porridge and ale at the same time? Surely you jest.
Everyone
*Sigh*

They all let out another round of huge, exaggerated sighs.
Will
So, what did you all want to gather here for today?

The four of them exchange glances before turning back to me.
Rob
Truth is, I've heard of a rumor making the rounds all over town.
Will
Again?
Kiki
Me too.
Thomas
And me.
Father
What a coincidence! I did as well.
Will
All of you? What's the rumor about?
Rob
You see...
Rob
There is a certain acting troupe that has become the hot topic of the town as of late. Apparently, they boast of having a genius playwright the likes of which the world has never seen.
Will
And?
Rob
As some rise, some fall, such is life. So, it seems that there those who suffered under the shadow of this prodigy's rise.
Marlowe
Why? Queen Elizabeth's secret theater party? I've never heard of such a thing!
Marlowe
Damn it all! This is outrageous! What blasted work did you write, Shakespeare?! Why did it have to be him?! Why wasn't it me?!
Marlowe
No, I will still win. I'll just gather more talented people and put together better written scenes.
Marlowe
There is no way I can lose to someone who writes on their own. The masses are fickle and forgetful. Soon they will forget even his name!
Marlowe
And then it'll be my moment to shine once more! My fame will go down in history! Hey! Where's the ale?! Bring me the bloody ale!
Marlowe
I'm Christopher Marlowe, you uncultured swine!
Kiki
The rumor goes that the sad little playwright frequented bars and made a fool out of himself day after day.
Will
Poor histrionic sap. Not that I know them personally.
Rob
He did shout his name just now, according to the rumor.
Father
But as life often teaches us, when one door closes, another one is soon to open. Apparently, the man came upon a compassionate noble.
Spencer
Oh, for the luna and the estrellas, what is going on here? I could have sworn I heard the pathetic cries of a downtrodden fool, so I thoughtlessly entered this commoner's pub.
Marlowe
...
Spencer
Aaah, who is this delicado, dulce chico that I see before me? Why, it almost seems like he could break at the slightest of touches.
Marlowe
What? Who are you supposed to be?
Spencer
My chico, true hermosura lies at the depths of the most extreme of misery.
Marlowe
I'm not miserable! Now answer my question! Who are you?!
Spencer
Ah, haah... Those defiant ojos, voz, pasion! How I wish to make them mine...
Spencer
I want to make you mine! I want to thoroughly break you into little pedacitos!
Thomas
Well, you could say his luck ran dry the moment he met this man.
Spencer
Ah, yes! Chicos, chicos are where it's at. Hard, strong chicos like you drive me crazy! You've charmed me hopelessly. Do you understand? Te amo!
Spencer
I want you ahora mismo. Right now.
Marlowe
Stop this nonsense! I'm a playwright who will carve his name out in history! Why would I ever want to—
Spencer
I am historia itself.
Marlowe
Huh?
Spencer
I am historia. I am this history you speak of.
Marlowe
You are history? Does that mean you are... historia?
Spencer
Si, ese soy yo.
Marlowe
Am I facing history itself right now?
Spencer
Si, asi es.
Marlowe
Hahahaha, ahahahah! To think the answer would come to me! Yes, all I have to do is carve myself into history itself! Truly, providence smiles upon the righteous!
Marlowe
I won! I did it! Victory is mine! Do you hear that, Shakespeare?! History is mine!
Spencer
Si, you must carve yourself into history.
Spencer
I want you to carve yourself deeply, thoroughly into me.
Marlowe
Yes! I will carve myself unto you! My mark will forever remain!
Spencer
Vamos!
Marlowe
Let's go!
Rob
And so, the two went off to the New World, hand in hand. Far away, where the screams of the playwright could never be heard.
Will
...
Will
That's all made up, isn't it?
Rob
Beats me! It's just a rumor!
Kiki
But it looks like it's true that the noble went away.
Father
Apparently, he had a fiancee.
Will
...How strange. Where did you all hear this rumor?
Kiki
From that guy over there.

Kiki points to...
Will
Oh? We have a new customer?

The uninvited guest pushes Rob and Kiki away and sits directly in front of me.

It's strange for someone to come into a pub and not take off their hat.

Speaking of which, I seem to remember a guest who did such a thing a good while ago.
Will
Sorry, friend. We're only open for regulars right now.
Will
I'm refusing first time customers, but... could it be we've met before?

Dad, Rob, Kiki, and Thomas all have silly grins on their faces all of a sudden.

I see. It looks like someone's putting on an act.
??
Those are some sad looking mashed potatoes, I must say.
Will
Oh no, the customers here really like them. They clean their plates and go on about how I serve dishes fit for a queen, even. Like this guy over here, see?
Rob
I regret my purchase! I wish I never set foot in this bloody pub!
??
I will buy this whole pub.
Will
Excuse me?

The odd customer turns their glimmering rose eyes on me.
??
If you are bored enough to do a disservice to all these poor potatoes, isn't there something else you should be doing?
Will
Now, what would that be? Can't say anything comes to mind.
??
Therefore, I will buy this pub. You go and write.
Will
Sadly, there's no one else to stand behind the counter but me.
Will
And from where I'm standing, you don't seem too fit for the job.
??
Heh...
Will
Why, you look like a natural born actress to me.
Will
We'd need to turn this into a stage fit for you to entertain the clients.
Will
Sorry to say, but I can't sell. This pub isn't even run for profit anymore.
??
What a small stage.
??
But I suppose it's better than not standing on anything.
Will
Well, that divorce didn't take long, eh?
Olivia
Ah, shut up, would you?
Olivia
I'll have you know that I am an unmarried, single lass. Spencer turned out to be committing bigamy.
Will
Really now?
Olivia
He married many women, apparently. Bigamy is prohibited in this country, right? All but his first marriage became null and void.
Will
Whoa, that's incredible.

Those vows before God that not even the Queen could do anything about.

And in the end, it was the law of this land that protected Olivia?

The very same laws that made us suffer so...

And now they're working in our favor?

It's kind of ironic, I must admit.
Rob
A right proper mess, eh?
Olivia
How rude of that hedonistic baboon. And here I was swearing in front of God. He made a bloody liar of me!
Will
It is convenient how you can feign indignation, as I'm sure you did, Miss Actress.
Olivia
Of course I did.
Olivia
So, is that the stage you prepared for me? A rather paltry offering, I must admit.
Will
It's not that bad when you're on it.
Olivia
I'm fed up of just working for the sake of it. Do you have suitable remuneration to offer me?
Will
You'll be the first to read all my scripts, for life.
Olivia
Not bad, but not quite enough.
Will
...

Olivia blows out a huge, exaggerated sigh.
Olivia
Oh, how I wonder if there is anyone around who would take an unmarried widow's hand in marriage.
Olivia
Do any of you know where I could find such a man?
Rob
Mmh...
Thomas
That's a good question, ma'am.
Kiki
Is there such a fearless, courageous man around these parts?
Father
I fear my son may not have the backbone for such a thing. Oh, I worry for that lad sometimes.
Will
...
Olivia
What a shame. I came running because I heard I could find one right here.
Will
Okay! I get it! I've had enough of the theater, guys!
Kiki
Oh!
Rob
Oooh!

Olivia looks up at me, her daring smile urging me on.
Will
Olivia.
Olivia
Yes?

I clear my throat.

I go around the counter, kneel in front of her, and gaze into those rose eyes.
Will
Stay by my side forever. Read what I write until death do us part.
Olivia
You said that already.
Will
Please, marry me, Olivia Berry.

Slowly, the most beautiful of smiles blossoms across her face.
Olivia
Now, that is what I wanted to hear.

To celebrate our reunion with Olivia, we drink like there's no morrow.

We started in the evening, but the merriment showed no sign of slowing down even as we hit midnight.

Everyone, me included, thought she was out of our lives, so it makes sense.

My head is spinning, and I can barely feel my legs.

I tongue feels heavy, and my head is throbbing already.

But man, those were the best drinks of my life.

We close up the store and go upstairs. In a flight of fancy, I pull a ladder out of the storeroom and climb up to the roof.

It's the first time I've been here since Dad lost his sight.
Olivia
It's news to me you had a place like this.

Olivia slides over to the handrail and leans against it.
Olivia
Not half bad, not at all.

She deftly raises her glass of wine to her full lips and takes a sip.

A slight blush colors her cheeks.

The lights shining from the house next door highlight her captivating figure.

The night breeze plays with her white hair.

Every gesture makes for the perfect picture of beauty.

I'm captivated by her, sipping on my ale as I gaze at the woman of my dreams.

She looks off into the distance for a while, until she turns around and notices my intent gaze.

Then she quirks a wolfish smile.
Olivia
Got something to say?
Will
I thought I lost you forever.
Olivia
...Me too.

She blows out an exaggeratedly annoyed sigh.
Olivia
Not being separated forever makes for a very lousy tragedy, wouldn't you say?
Olivia
We went and ruined all the emotion of our final parting. Now I just feel stupid for all the tears I shed on my way out.
Will
You cried?

When I say that, Olivia directs the mother of all glares at me.
Olivia
Obviously! But you were in such a state that I decided to hold my tears until I was alone.
Olivia
Did I cry? Did you really just ask me that? Perhaps you're not as good a bard as I thought you were.
Will
Uh, I'm sorry.
Olivia
I cannot believe you! I want my tears back!
Will
I don't know about that...
Olivia
Then say something sensible for once! How about making me feel like I finally came back to the arms of my beloved poet instead of a lousy potato smasher?! Would you mind?

The alcohol is making the world spin around me.

But I decide to meet Olivia's challenge.

For my legs may be jelly, but a self-respecting poet can always make his woman feel loved.

I raise a finger in front of my eyes to try and give me a faint sense of balance.

Before I begin, a hiccup escapes my mouth. Not the best start, admittedly.

Olivia lowers her eyebrows in a show of contempt, but her smile doesn't diminish one bit.
Will
You speak true when you say it would make for a lousy tragedy. It is a travesty of the highest order.
Will
For a couple to shed bitter tears as they separate only to be reunited not even a moon hence would be a disappointment. Not even worth putting to paper, really.

Olivia slightly tilts her head to the side and waits for me to continue.
Will
However... We are not here to live out beautiful stories.
Will
Even if it's a disgraceful conclusion, even if it's a story that would be met with the rolling eyes of an audience, I am truly ecstatic to see you again.
Will
I cannot lie to my own heart of hearts. This is how it should be. If I can spend my life with you, I have no regrets.
Will
I would not care even if I was never to lift a quill again.
Olivia
Not so fast. You must write, remember? You promised me!
Olivia
Why, I love the stories as much as I love the man himself.

Olivia says, smiling fondly at me.

The night breeze blows past us yet again.

Olivia closes her eyes and enjoys the soft caress of the night wind.
Olivia
I wished with all my being to be able to meet you one more time, even if it was just in my dreams.

Then she slowly opens her eyes again.

Her red eyes are fixed on me, seeming to gleam with a glow of their own.
Olivia
I still feel like I'm dreaming.
Will
I can tell you I'm not dreaming. I've got a splitting headache threatening to kill me right now.

Olivia throws her head back and lets out a hearty laugh.
Olivia
Well then, why don't you make me feel it's not a dream too?

She extends one hand to me.
Olivia
If I can feel the burning heat I felt in your arms that night once again, I may yet be convinced I'm not just under Orpheus' little spell.

Her enchanting eyes draw me in as she suggestively flutters her lashes.

I take her hand with mine, pull her into my arms, and meet her welcoming lips with my own.

Olivia leans into me without a second's hesitation, entrusting herself into me.

I wrap an arm around her lovely waist and pull her closer into me.

I feel her against me, just like the day we parted.

After a long while, we reluctantly part the kiss.

She turns her brilliant eyes up to me, the blush in her cheeks matching their rosy sheen.
Will
Still dreaming?
Olivia
No, this is real.

She says, burying her face into my chest.
Will
Welcome back, my love.
Olivia
It's good to be home.
