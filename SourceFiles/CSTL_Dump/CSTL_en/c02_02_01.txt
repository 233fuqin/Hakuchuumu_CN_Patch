It's bright out there.

I was writing, and...

Right. I've got a group of four—two men, two women—and the fairy.

I already know I want to end on a big wedding scene, but it still doesn't feel like enough.

Say, why don't I throw in a group of completely unrelated actors for good measure?

They can get caught up in the fairy's mischief too.

Then they can be the entertainment for the wedding, which gives me an excuse to bring the cast together.

That way, everything will feel neatly tied up by the time the curtains close.
Will
...
Will
Uh... Oh?

My forehead hurts.

How long have I been passed out atop my desk?

I suppose the fatigue had to catch up to me at some point.
Will
Ah!

I jump out of my chair and grab the script.

Did I fall asleep while thinking of ideas? Have I not written a single word?!

My eyes run over the letters on the parchment in a frantic hurry.
Will
*Sigh* Thank God...

Thankfully, everything I came up with is actually written down here.

I somehow managed to make all the additions before passing out.

After stretching my aching limbs, I gather the papers together.

But then, I hear a sound coming from the ground floor.
Will
Dad?

Going downstairs to the pub, I find my dad peeling potatoes in his usual spot at the counter.
Will
Oh, good morning.
Father
Ah, you're up. Morning, Son. Sorry about yesterday.
Will
Are you sure you should be up?
Father
I'm fine. Ed came by this morning. He brought soup and all.
Will
Really? That's good to hear.
Father
Were you out last night?
Will
...Yeah, for a bit.
Father
I see.
Will
I think I may need to go out for a bit again tonight, while it's just the regulars here and there's not much business going on.
Father
We never get much business, so feel free to go out whenever.
Will
Uh, that kind of stings.

Rob and Ed show up as soon as we open up shop for the night.

They must be worried about my dad.

Both are immediately relieved to see him sitting in his usual spot.

I look out the window to see the sun sinking below the horizon.

Olivia said to bring her the script before midnight.

If it's only Rob and Ed here, I can leave the pub to them for a while and run out to deliver the revised script.

There's still time to spare.

The mood is relaxed as I chat amicably with them.
Rob
You managed to hand in the script?
Will
Yeah, I got the rest of the money. The client wasn't Spencer, but a woman he was with.
Rob
Yeah, right. That pretty lass with the strong attitude.
Will
I was ordered to fix the script, so I ended up passing out at my desk last night.
Father
All right! Time to celebrate my recovery! A toast to good friends!
Will
No way.
Ed
I can't allow that. You've already caused me more than enough anxiety.
Father
But my boys, ale is the best medicine!
Will
More like the source of a thousand ailments.
Rob
Truer words have never been spoken! Don't push your luck now, Boss.
Father
Ngh...
Will
Oh, welcome.

The front door opens, and a group of customers comes in.
Rob
Uh, wh-what's this?
Customers
Hello, folk! You have space for us? We have eight people here.
Will
Eight? I-I'm afraid we...
Rob
What're you saying, lad?! It'll be a bit of a squeeze, but come right in!
Father
That's right, you fool! Get that bread!
Ed
I know it might not be the most polite thing to say, but this is truly a rarity. Let me make some space for you all.

Ed says, addressing the group of men.
Rob
You can say that again. Are all the other pubs in Tenbridge closed or something?
Father
Ah, shut up, you idiots. Come now, budge up next to me.

Rob and Ed pull their seats in closer to my father to make space.
Customers
Ah, there's space? Thank you kindly.

The men troop in one after the other.

They settle in their seats then place their orders.

Rob was right.

Did all the pubs in town close today or something?

I try to hide my frustration as I continue serving them from behind the bar.
Will
...

By the time the big group leaves, it's already past midnight.

I can tell without looking at a clock. In this business, you soon develop an internal time tracker.

We sold a lot tonight.

I'm honestly overjoyed at that.

But I wonder why it had to be today of all days.

My fatigue weighs down heavier as I silently clean up the leftover plates and cups.

Now that it's just the four of us, the pub is quiet once again.

It's too late now.

Am I gonna get hounded by that noble with the weird manner of speech, or will I just get thrown straight into prison before getting killed off or whatever?
Rob
Hey, Lad. What's wrong? You're not drinking? It's not every day that Ed treats you.
Will
Ah, uh, right. I'll drink.
Ed
We're finally back to the usual calm, so let's get back to our seats and relax for a bit.
??
...
Will
Ah, welcome...

A new customer comes in.

He's tall and slender and is wearing a baggy hat.

He's... an unusual sight to say the least.

Usually we cycle through the same few regular patrons here, but I can't remember seeing this person before.

The new customer takes a seat at the end of the bar.

I serve him some of the mashed potatoes I prepared beforehand.
Will
What'll it be? Ale?
??
...

The silent customer points to a bottle behind the counter.

There's a bottle of aqua vitae sitting on the shelf behind me.
Will
You wanna drink that? It's pretty strong. And expensive too.

The customer slams his hand down onto the counter.

Then he raises it slowly, leaving behind enough money to eclipse a usual day's worth of sales.
??
I'll buy the bottle.
Will
...

A frown streaking my face, I take the bottle, put it in front of him, and serve a glassful.
??
...

After gazing at the tawny liquid swirling in his cup for a moment, he points at me.
Will
What, you want me to drink?

He slowly nods.
Rob
Oooh! You got guts, lad! You wanna give Will a run for his money, eh?
Father
That sounds fun. That boy of mine is no lightweight. He got that from me.
Ed
But we cannot guarantee he'll be a friendly drunk. Sadly, he got that from his dad as well.
??
Heh...

The guy raises his cup.

I take another cup and pour myself some liquor.

I raise my cup. We clink them together and drink up.

The thick liquid burns a hot trail as it goes down my throat.

A bitter and slightly sweet aftertaste remains in my mouth.
??
Hah...

He blows out a quiet breath then sets his cup back on the counter, signaling for more.
Will
Heh, this is getting interesting.

I serve us both another round of drinks.

And just like the first, we down them in one go.

Again, the fiery liquid leaves a hot trail on its way to my stomach.

The guy puts his cup back on the counter immediately.

I notice a smug grin touching his lips.

Those thin lips seem slightly familiar, for some reason.
Will
...

I try to follow the thread of thought, but the drinks are already fogging my mind.

And the lack of sleep can't be helping me any.

I pour us another round.

And the cups empty as fast as the first time.
Will
...

I feel the third drink settle in my stomach.

The heat starts to creep up from my belly, and I can feel it in my cheeks now.
??
...

From the glimpse of the man's face that I can see under the hat, he's having no difficulties handling the alcohol.

I don't have a good feeling about this.

I'm not stupid. I am under no illusions that I can win here.

But I can't pull out now.

He tips his cup forward.

There's still liquor left in the bottle.

Our customers usually do nothing but drink cheap ale and slurp down the insipid mashed potatoes I make.

It's rare to say the least that anyone asks for spirits.

I serve the next round.

This time I choke a little on the first gulp and leave some liquid in the cup.

I go for a second swig and take care of the leftovers.

But by the time I look down, the other man's cup is already set for more.
Will
What the heck's up with you?
Rob
Oi, Will. You throwing in the towel already?
Will
Remind me again who ruined my sleep schedule with a rush job.
Father
Shall I tag in for you, Son?
Will
What kind of father sticks his neck in a kid's fight?
Ed
Friends, we should all calm down a little.

The guy takes the bottle himself and serves for the two of us.

Driven by indignation, I grab the fifth cup and force it down my throat.

I feel the liquor running over my tongue like a hot, numbing fire.

It takes me several swigs, but it does down.

My throat is burning up.

And the sweet aftertaste is like a cloud of unpleasant fumes.
Will
I think...
Rob
Whoa?!
Will
...I'm done for...
Ed
Told you so...

If I was in peak condition, five cups wouldn't even rattle me...

I want to say this out loud, but my consciousness is fading faster than I can open my mouth. My eyelids and tongue feel like lead.
Will
...

When I wake up, only my dad and the mystery customer are left in the pub.

It looks like I was out a while.
Will
Huh?
Father
Hm? You awake?
Will
Yeah.
Father
That was a sorry display. Don't pick a fight if you're gonna lose.
Will
I'm just under the weather today, sheesh.

I wobble up, still reeling from the drinks.

I have the mother of all headaches.

The back of my throat feels dry and scorched.

The customer is still in the same seat, drinking ale now.

I slowly stand up and move around to the other side of the counter.
Will
Hey, you can hold your drinks pretty well.
Will
You really showed me. Satisfied now?
??
...
Will
It's been a pleasure and all, but it's time to close, and I can't serve you in this state. Could I ask you to leave?
??
You're a courageous one indeed to start your first day by breaking a deadline.
??
You're off to a bad start, slave.
Father
Mm?

The voice is a little different, but it sounds like...

I fearfully peer under the hat...

And see a gleaming pair of rose-colored eyes glaring out at me.
Will
You!
Olivia
Have you already forgotten how I ordered you to address me?
Will
L-Lady Olivia...
Olivia
That will suffice, I suppose.
Father
Lady Olivia?
Olivia
So, would you care to inform me why you ignored your master's direct orders in favor of doing... whatever this is?
Father
Ahahahah! When did you become someone's slave, boy?
Will
This is no laughing matter.
Olivia
Yes. You were about to lose your neck over thievery charges. It is, indeed, no laughing matter.
Father
Thievery? Hey, is that true, Son?
Will
Yeah...
Father
Did I really raise such a fool? Why would you do such a thing?
Will
...
Will
We can talk about that later.
Father
What?!

I turn back to Olivia.
Will
Sorry. No, actually. Would you hear me out?
Olivia
Have you already forgotten your oath from yesterday?
Will
...
Father
Huh? Is that a woman's voice?
Olivia
Yes. I never said I was a man, did I?
Father
Oh my. I suppose you didn't.
Will
What are you going around dressed like that for?
Olivia
It's convenient, you see.

She says, taking off her hat and letting loose her long locks of hair.
Olivia
So, any last words? No lingering regrets?
Will
I know I messed up. I fixed the script, I just couldn't get out of the pub until—
Olivia
Show me.

Olivia presents her hand to me.

I sigh and reach for the rolled up script from under the counter.

She snatches it from me and begins flipping through the pages at a fast pace.
Will
I did what you asked. I was up all night writing...

She completely ignores my explanation.

Olivia seems more interested in devouring the script with her eyes.
Will
...

It looks like I'll have to wait for her to finish reading.
Olivia
Good. You improved it.

She murmurs, standing up.

Then, she begins reading out parts of the script aloud.

The scene where a woman exclaims her love for a person she hated up until she was slipped a love potion by the trickster fairy.

Olivia recites the man's lines with perfect dramatic cadence.
Father
Whoa, what a nice voice.
Olivia
Mm, it's a good line, but the rhythm is a bit off. Hey, can we change the wording so—
Will
Wait.
Olivia
...

Olivia shoots me a suspicious look.

That outfit she's wearing intrigued me.

But after hearing that adept vocalization, I'm now certain.

...
Will
Dad.
Father
Yeah?
Will
I have something I need to talk to this customer about, and it's a little personal.
Father
Huh?
Will
Can you leave things here to me?
Father
Oh, well. It's not like you're giving me any ale anyway.
Will
Of course I'm not.
Father
All right, then. You two be nice to each other now.
Olivia
Thank you. Have a good night.

My father takes his cane and goes up the stairs.

Olivia stares after him for a moment.

When he's gone, the only people left in the pub are me and Olivia.
Will
You...
Olivia
How many times do I have to repeat myself? Call me—
Will
You're thinking of performing on stage?!
Olivia
...Whatever do you mean?

I heave an internal sigh of relief.

I suppose even these out of touch nobles have a lick of common sense.

It's prohibited for women to appear on stage like male actors do.

Committing such a sin in front of a crowd of spectators would be akin to slicing your own neck with a sword. The crown wouldn't react kindly to such an offense either.
Will
Never mind, I just thought that—
Olivia
Of course I am.
Will
What?
Olivia
What do you think I made you my slave for?
Olivia
You're here to write the best plays for me, obviously.
Will
Wait a moment! You...
Will
You're a woman!
Olivia
So what?
Will
You can't act on stage! What batty troupe leader would approve this?!
Olivia
That would be me.
Will
Dios mio santo!

Now I'm talking like that madman Spencer.
Olivia
Is there a problem?
Will
How would there NOT be?!
Olivia
Well, you're going to stand on that very same stage.
Will
Excuse me?!
Will
No, wait. Wait a second.
Will
Am I having a bad dream right now?
Will
I'm actually still knocked out from the liquor, right? That must be it.
Will
I have to be. There is no way a woman could be the leader of an acting troupe in Tenbridge.
Will
I wasn't just imagining things when I thought you were off.
Olivia
Well now, that's one tall wall of delusions you're building there.
Olivia
Specially when you didn't notice a thing until I told you.
Olivia
Are those precious jade eyes for decoration alone?
Will
...A pub is no place for a woman to come on her own. I didn't imagine one ever would.
Olivia
Neither is the stage a place for a woman to be, right?
Will
...
Olivia
I see your tiny brain is still struggling to follow, so let me put it in a way a five year old would understand.
Will
Ugh...
Olivia
Allow me to enlighten you. Right now, your life is in the palm of my hands.
Olivia
Whether you live or die is my prerogative. The preconceptions in your mind are now mine, and I am what molds and guides your thoughts.
Olivia
You will forget those stupid preconceptions that tell you that women cannot be in pubs or perform on stages.
Olivia
Because those foolish ideas do not exist in me. You will cast those discriminating ideas from your mind, this very instant.

After this monologue, she stands up.
Olivia
I have the script now. Rehearsals will begin tomorrow.
Olivia
I will not tolerate absences. Next time you won't get away with just an earful.
Will
Are you saying you'll kill me?
Olivia
I think a pampered boy like you would perhaps prefer death.
Will
You damn—
Olivia
I am your master and troupe leader. Choose your words wisely.
Will
...I promised to write plays. I'll write as many as I need.
Will
I'll write masterpieces that you couldn't even think of if you banged your head against a desk for the rest of your lie.
Olivia
You can't possibly do that as you are right now.
Will
What?
Olivia
Reading your revisions today made me certain. It's out of your reach at the moment.
Will
And why would that be?
Olivia
You're going only from what's in your head, aren't you? It's the same for your dialogues and movements. You've never stood on a stage, and it shows.
Will
...
Olivia
Your use of sound is particularly lacking. The story flow is good, but I couldn't point to any line in it as something that could go down in history.
Olivia
And I doubt it'll change until you stand upon the stage and recite lines with the audience's eyes upon you.
Olivia
The hearts of the audience are more distant than you could ever imagine, but also more sensitive. If the rhythm is bad, no one will be able to relate to you.
Will
And that's supposed to be a playwright's job?
Olivia
Undoubtedly so. That is one idea of mine that you have to make yours.
Will
Appearing on stage is a bit much. I'm not an actor.
Will
And why in the world would I ever go on stage with a woman? I have enough threats of execution without you trying to get me killed by the crown on top of it.
Olivia
Hmm, so you...

A steady, quiet fire lights up in her eyes.
Olivia
You're an incompetent oaf who can't do anything but write.
Olivia
Let me ask you this: Is your calling to stand behind that little counter? Is that what you're living for?
Will
...I need to run this pub.
Will
You can call me an ignorant or pampered boy all you want, but I have to be my father's eyes.

She narrows her eyes at me.
Will
What meaning will my life have if I have to abandon my dad and our pub for it?
Olivia
Hah, you crack me up.
Olivia
You're just sidestepping the problem. You're even blaming your father for your inability to find a meaning to your life.
Will
No! I'm not...!
Olivia
I see even poets lose their eloquence when you hit them where it hurts.
Will
...
Will
I fixed the script like you asked, but acting on stage is a whole different matter.
Will
Go ahead and kill me if that's what you're gonna do.

I take a deep breath.

Olivia looks up at me, seeming remarkably unruffled.

The silence continues for a while.
Olivia
Who would I even kill?
Will
...
Olivia
You're not even living your own life.
Olivia
Why should you fear death as you are right now?
Olivia
You're like a little baby who's never stood on his own two feet.
Olivia
Why, those eyes have never seen anything for themselves.
Olivia
How could I kill what isn't even alive? It's like you're dead already.
Will
...
Olivia
Fear of death won't move you. I mean, you already died yesterday. The person standing here right now is my slave.
Will
...I need to look after the pub. I can't just close it down.
Olivia
You're nothing if not a source of excuses.
Will
Run your mouth all you want. You would never know how hard it is to earn your keep every single day without knowing if you'll eat tomorrow.

Olivia slowly picks up her hat.
Olivia
Rehearsal starts at noon in the Globe.

She says, donning the hat just like before.
Olivia
Tardiness won't be forgiven a second time.

She leaves, obviously uninterested in whether I'm okay with the time frame or not.

I take a deep breath and sigh.

Then I raise my fist and slam it down on the counter with all my might.

...

I'm extremely annoyed.

He has not an inkling of the awareness one needs to be a professional.

Why was such talent bestowed upon such an idiotic, naive boy?

If I was blessed with such literary talent, I would be creating masterpieces daily.

I am so deeply annoyed.

I'm sure he doesn't even realize he's acting like a child.

Well then. I'll crush down all of his flimsy excuses.

So he wants time. Fine, I'll give it to him.

I did it all before becoming a noble.

Customer service, scrubbing floors, cooking, you name it.

I can do it all twice as fast and better than him.

I certainly wouldn't have gotten caught stealing deer like he did.

And I speak from experience.

He's too green, in every sense of the word.

I don't have time to dismantle each of his silly little walls one by one.

The selection to see who will perform for the court is at hand.
Will
...

Olivia's carefree tone still rings in my head.

I don't have the script at hand, but the lines are still fresh in my mind.
Will
Damn it all.

I pick up my quill.

She was right. I know which lines would be hard to enunciate in a real-life setting.

Everything she said was right.

Everything...

Her voice worms its way into my brain.

I'll internalize her delivery and rewrite the rough lines into something that'll resonate in the most beautiful way with her voice.

The course of true love never did run smooth

...Love blinds us sometimes.

No, the rhythm is all wrong.

Maybe like this.
Will
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind...

Yes, this is it. This embodies the play's very essence.

She calls me slave, comes in front of my family and friends to humiliate me, and does nothing but deride me with her every word.

My head is full of her voice.

My quill glides over the parchment like never before.
Will
Damn woman...

Clenching my teeth as what I hope looks like a wolfish smile spreads across my face, I let the quill dance across the parchment with a mind of its own.
