Kaito
There are still many things I don't understand.
Kaito
But I've decided what it is I want to get back first.
Izumo
What is that?

Izumo stares at me, her tone as monotonous as ever.

I watch her staring at me from the corner of my eye.

A faint smile touches my lips.

Little by little, I'm coming to like this aloof girl.

Perhaps...

Perhaps, even after being wiped so many times, the faint traces of my memories are starting to coalesce within me.
Kaito
When that time comes, you'll understand.

I use the same phrase she said to me once before and smile at her.

She simply stares at my profile as I look up at the night sky, her expression unfazed.

The stars twinkle in the distant sky.

I wonder if the night breeze blows beyond the lens separating us from it.

I wonder...

Does Yonagi imagine that wind enveloping us as well? What goes through her mind?
Kaito
Let's go back.
Izumo
Inside?

I shake my head.
Kaito
To Yonagi's dream.
Izumo
All of Yonagi's dreams...
Kaito
Huh?
Izumo
They have progressed beyond what was planned for. If we transmit the mapping data we have saved from her brain, you can continue whichever dream you want.
Kaito
Uh, mapping data?
Izumo
Wooleep has been recording the sensory signals in her brain.

So we can nudge her towards a particular dream by stimulating the parts of her brain that activate during each of them.
Kaito
And you have the data for all the dreams. Three of them, right?
Izumo
Yes.

I smile again.
Izumo
Hm?
Kaito
I only remember one of those dreams.
Kaito
But Wooleep has the data for all three of them, right?

She gives me a small nod.
Kaito
How strange. Who dreamed those other two with her?

She stares at me in complete silence.
Kaito
Never mind. Just tell me one thing: Is this the first time this experiment has come this far?
Kaito
Or have we had this conversation more than once?
Izumo
This is the first time all of Yonagi's dreams have progressed further than our control values. The plan is progressing.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito
And I can believe it when you say that?
Izumo
From now on, your memory will not be initialized.
Izumo
You can trust my words.
Kaito
...Well, I suppose I'll have to.

In other words, they have initialized my memory several times in the past.
Kaito
So, how do I choose the dream?
Izumo
Just tell me which one you want to continue. Which dream would you like to see?
