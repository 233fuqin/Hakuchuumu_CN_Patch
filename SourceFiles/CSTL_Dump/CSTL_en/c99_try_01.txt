Kaito
Mm... H-Huh?
Izumo
Good morning.
Kaito
Uh, where's Yonagi?
Izumo
Still sleeping.
Kaito
Oh, I see.

I glance at the bed on the other side of the room. Yonagi's still lying there, breathing quiet and even.
Kaito
What's wrong?
Izumo
Hm?
Kaito
I thought we were having the same dream.
Izumo
That is correct.
Izumo
But now, she has started having a different dream.
Kaito
Different?

Izumo nods.
Izumo
Your memory needs to be initialized.
Kaito
What do you mean?
Izumo
You are the receptor for her dream world. Any past memories you have will only become noise.
Kaito
You're erasing my memories again?
Izumo
That's right.
Kaito
Wait a second. You can't just do this.
Kaito
I don't even remember anything from before two days ago.
Izumo
I am sorry. I have already received the pertinent permission from the concerned party regarding the initialization process in the event of an error such as this.
Kaito
You mean... me?
Izumo
You when you had your whole memory, to be exact.
Kaito
Wait! Even if I'm going to lose the memories anyway, I still want to know what happened.
Kaito
Weren't you managing the dreams and sequencing them like a story?
Kaito
I'm still halfway through a dream. Why is this happening out of nowhere?
Izumo
It is Yonagi who decides the contents of the dream. You receive the images from her, and your reactions return to Yonagi.
Izumo
To progress the dream requires interaction between the two of you. But now there is a gap between you and her dream world.
Kaito
What caused it?
Izumo
Unknown.
Kaito
...
Kaito
What happens if I don't want to do this? Do you really need to erase my memories to resolve this situation?
Izumo
Literally nothing will happen.
Izumo
You will remain in this facility, unable to leave, and Yonagi will keep on dreaming without waking up.
Kaito
What?
Izumo
The only thing that can advance her dream is the interactions between you and her.
Izumo
Unless there is a reaction signal from the receptor, Yonagi will keep on sending the same signal in hopes of getting a response.
Izumo
It would mean that the goal of this plan would not be achieved. Therefore, nothing would happen.
Kaito
She'd keep sleeping? Goal of the plan?

I turn to Yonagi once more.

Her chest is moving up and down faintly.
Izumo
To recover Yonagi's ego. That is the goal of this plan.

I asked her before what all this was for.

Yesterday, she denied me that information.
Kaito
You didn't tell me that yesterday. Why now?
Izumo
Because the initialization has already been decided.
Izumo
You don't have to do anything. Just fall asleep.
Izumo
Wooleep will perform a selective memory cleaning on you. There will be no pain. When you wake again, you won't remember this conversation happened.
Kaito
Wha... Nnh...

Suddenly, speaking becomes hard.

My eyelids feel like they're made out of lead.

My mind dims, and my vision narrows.
Kaito
W-Wait...
Kaito
H-How many times...
Kaito
Have I... lost my... memories...
Izumo
This is the first time.
Kaito
...
Izumo
Rest well, Kaito.
