...

When I wake up...

There are tears moistening my eyes.

I scoop them up with my fingers and stare vacantly at them.

The end of Yonagi's dream.

When that time comes, I will know.

That's what Izumo said.
Kaito
I see now.

The stories come to an end when Yonagi and I are separated.

I raise myself up and turn to Yonagi.

She's also shedding silent tears from her closed eyes.
Izumo
Good morning.
Kaito
Morning.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Izumo
The mapping of this dream is complete. We need to send another sensory signal to Yonagi.
Izumo
Two dreams are left.
Kaito
My memories remained this time.
Izumo
Yes. However, Yonagi's brain processes will switch once we input data originating from another dream.
Izumo
This is necessary to ensure the plan is secure and maximize the results.
Kaito
Which means?
Izumo
Her recovery may seem to have regressed, but it's just a superficial change.
Izumo
Lastly, we will consolidate all the areas of her brain that are activated by each of the three dreams.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito
And that's the safest and most precise way to save Yonagi.
Kaito
Or at least, that's what someone has judged to be the case.
Izumo
Correct.
Kaito
...

I feel a bitter smile form on my face.

I have a pretty good idea of who that someone is by now.
Izumo
Please choose the next dream.
Kaito
...Okay.
