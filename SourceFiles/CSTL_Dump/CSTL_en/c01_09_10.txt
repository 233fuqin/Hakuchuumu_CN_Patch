The sound chalk dragging across the blackboard echoes in the silent classroom.

Lifeless and wearisome, like me.

My hand keeps on writing out of pure habit.

I keep doing so for four classrooms, just like I've done for years.

Today as well...

I'll stay here, and keep repeating the usual routine. Without changing anything.

It feels wrong.

The sound of the chalk.

The heavy silence of the classroom.

I can't stay here a second longer.

Among these innocent students.

Even the rebellious heart of the worst behaved is so earnest that it becomes suffocating.

I can feel my hand tensing up as I hold the chalk.

It begins to tremble.

But I carry on writing.
Arishima
...

The chalk breaks and falls to the floor.

I follow the small bits of chalk as they fall with my eyes.

I stay still for a moment.

I hear the whispers begin to spread behind my back.

How long will I keep doing this?

How long can I keep it up?

I glance at the wall clock.

It's almost time for the class to end.

I put down the broken chalk.
Arishima
It's a little early, but let's leave class here for today.

Some of the students who don't usually pay attention during class look at me with bulging eyes.

The buzz in the classroom grows even larger.

I just grab the attendance register, my bag, and get out at a brisk pace.

In all my years as a part-time teacher, I had never finished a class before the chime of the bell.

After all the classes are over...

I don't feel like going to the library or back home, so I end up in the smoking area.

Perhaps this is the only place that I have left now.

I take out a cig.

My very last one.

I light it up and pop it in my mouth.

I take out the note Rin gave me yesterday and look at it as I exhale smoke.

What place is this?

Rin said she's be waiting.

Is she waiting in this place?

Waiting for me to come?

...What if I go?

I'll probably become more miserable.

But...

She may be waiting for me for a long time if I don't.

I imagine her in strange place, standing all alone.

What do I do? What SHOULD I do? I...

While I dig myself into a mental hole, the cig burns out.

I'm left just staring at the ceiling.
Watanabe
Oh, you're coming here after class now, huh?
Arishima
Yeah.
Arishima
Give me one.

His eyes widen in pure surprise.
Watanabe
Did hell freeze over?

He fishes out a cig from the packet in his pocket and hands it over.

I take it, and light it up.
Watanabe
I can't even remember the last time you ran out of them. This must be the first.
Arishima
That so?
Watanabe
Yes, so!

His cigs are a lot blander than mine.
Watanabe
Not going to the library today?
Arishima
Nah...
Watanabe
What happened?
Arishima
Nothing.
Watanabe
Huh, really?
Arishima
...
Watanabe
...
Arishima
I have a regret.

Watanabe turns to me.

I just stare as the cig in my hand consumes itself.
Arishima
I shouldn't have done something I'm not used to.
Watanabe
Not used to?
Arishima
I wish I wouldn't have written that novel.
Watanabe
...Really?

I turn to Watanabe.
Watanabe
I think I would have lots of fun if I could write stuff.
Arishima
...Maybe people that can actually write feel that way.
Watanabe
Huh? Didn't you say you finished writing it?
Arishima
..Yeah, but...

I scratch at the back of my head.
Arishima
...A student read it.

Watanabe freezes for a moment where he is.

He's silent, just staring at me.
Arishima
...I was told that I didn't depict the person I was trying to evoke.
Watanabe
Tough crowd.

He lets out a hearty laugh.
Watanabe
What? A little critic pulled the rug from under you?
Arishima
It's not as simple as you make it sound.
Watanabe
Maybe I really should start writing novels myself.
Arishima
Wait, what?
Watanabe
I wanna get verbally abused by a student too.
Arishima
...

I look up at him in disbelief.

But his expression is completely serious.
Watanabe
I want to get stepped on.
Arishima
...Ok.
Watanabe
I'm joking, man.
Arishima
I know.
Watanabe
But what's so bad about it? It's kinda like being in a literature club, no?
Arishima
A 45-year old married teacher is too old for a club.
Watanabe
What does age have to do with anything here?

I look up at him.
Watanabe
I don't think the kind of guy that thinks his life is over after 40 would go and lose sleep over writing a novel over the last two weeks. No offense.
Arishima
...
Watanabe
You actually looked like alive as of late, minus the eye bags.
Arishima
...Really?
Watanabe
Yeah, you looked tired as hell.
Arishima
Heh... Alive?
Watanabe
Yeah.
Watanabe
You still look that way, if you ask me.

Now I'm the one with wide eyes.

I thought I was on the bottom of the barrel...

But I look... alive?

Me?
Watanabe
You always had dead fish eyes, but now they're almost blazing.
Arishima
Uh...
Watanabe
To be honest, I kinda of respect you for that. I mean, at that age people don't usually get stuff that makes them glow like that. Something they're crazy about, you know?
Arishima
We're about 10 years apart, though.
Watanabe
I'm telling you it doesn't matter.
Watanabe
I think the worry you had before about being unable to write was way worse. Don't you think?
Arishima
I wonder. I feel a lot more tired now.
Arishima
I lost my guide as soon as I came out of my comfort zone. You could say I'm worse off than before, in a way.
Watanabe
Mmh... So, what's the story anyway?

I look up at him again and wait.
Watanabe
What's the novel about.
Arishima
A story I wrote with Hatano Shuho as the main character. He was a senior of mine in a writing seminar back in college.
Watanabe
Uuuuh, who?

Taken aback, I stare at him.
Arishima
Hatano Rin's father. We talked about her at the bar, remember?
Watanabe
Errr, what was it again? She's the daughter of some famous writer, right?
Arishima
You don't know about Hatano Shuho?
Watanabe
Nah.

He shakes his head.
Arishima
Not even a novel of him?
Watanabe
Uuh, maybe?

I name some of his masterpieces for him.

But it doesn't seem like any of them ring a bell in his head.
Watanabe
I've got no idea, huh?
Arishima
...

I can't do anything but laugh.
Watanabe
Hey, no need to make fun of me.
Arishima
No, no, sorry. It just opened my eyes.
Watanabe
Huh?
Arishima
Can't change the world, huh?
Watanabe
O-Okay? Uh, sorry?
Arishima
Don't apologize, I think that helped me a whole lot. I may have been overthinking things.
Watanabe
Really? Anyway, I guess I see why you two talk so much now.

I turn to him again, curious.
Watanabe
You knew her dad and all.
Arishima
Oh, right.
Watanabe
Guess that does put her in a good position to guide you.

Puzzled, I stare at him.
Arishima
Guide?
Watanabe
Huh? Didn't you ask her to check your novel since she knew her dad?
Arishima
Uh...

I take Rin's note out of my pocket again.
Arishima
Guide, huh?

Hatano Shuho's daughter is my guide, then.

After I'm finished with work for the day, I head to the address she wrote down.

The address is in a neighboring town I can catch a bus to from my nearest station.

It reminds me of the first day we spoke.

I take another look at the note.

Her handwriting is very neat and prim.

I get off the bus as soon as my guide app tells me to, and then walk the rest of the way.

The designated place seems to be an elegant-looking low-rise condominium complex.

She's standing by the entrance.

She notices me and bows her head in a greeting.

Her expression seems pretty neutral the whole time.
Arishima
Here?
Rin
You'll understand when you come.

Rin says, before turning around and entering the complex.

This is a pretty fancy place. A unit here must cost a pretty penny.

She slowly walks down the hallway, then stops by a door and produces a key.
Arishima
Hm?

She unlocks the door and goes inside.

I follow after her.

A collection of books covers the walls entirely.

And those that don't fit are piled up onto the desks or the floor.

The windows are crushed by the stacked bookshelves.
Arishima
Do you, uh, live here?

She slowly shakes her head.
Rin
My house is somewhere else. It's a short walk from here.
Rin
This was my father's studio.
Arishima
Whoa...

On closer inspection, there seems to be a good amount of notebooks besides the books.
Arishima
Why bring me here?
Rin
Because he only was his true self in this place.

Rin says, as she picks up a notebook and hands it to me.
Arishima
Can I... read it?

Rin simply nods.

I open the notebook.
Arishima
...

Messy handwriting spreads across the pages.

This isn't writing...

It feels more like hatred being put to paper. Abuse and insults strewn about haphazardly in the paper.

Without a care for the delineated lines. It's like something a mad person would write in a frenzy of hate.
Arishima
What is this?
Rin
I don't know. I never really feel like looking into these books too much.
Arishima
...
Rin
This is the place where I met him for the last time.
Rin
He hadn't gotten in contact for a long time, and calls from his work were coming in.
Rin
And when I came here, he was already dead.
Arishima
...Here?

I take another overview of the room.
Arishima
It was reported as a heart attack, though.

She slowly shakes her head.
Rin
The bathtub was full of blood from his slashed wrist. It was already dry and black by the time I got here.
Arishima
...
Arishima
Suicide?

Rin nods.
Rin
My father never... Hatano Shuho never saw me eye to eye, not even once.
Rin
He died without ever being a father to me.

Rin walks into the room.
Rin
I don't have the courage to try and face the person he was, but...
Rin
The answer you're looking for is here.
Rin
Because the real Hatano Shuho was only truly alive when he was in this room.

Rin stops in front of the desk, and gently runs her fingers through the open laptop resting on it.
Rin
That man was broken by a life of lies.
Rin
He never was my father, not even in the end.
Rin
I think he couldn't accept his true self.
Rin
That's why writing only served to drive him into a wall more and more.
Rin
Spinning words that didn't belong to anyone while never facing his true self.

She raises her face and turns to me.
Rin
You can't follow after his footsteps.
Rin
I see it. You're so much like him.
Arishima
...
Rin
The version of my father you depicted was beautiful beyond words. Transparent, pure, and without an ounce of malice.
Rin
But...
Rin
The last thing my real father wasn't the family he lost. He never thought of anyone but himself.
Rin
If you came to know that Hatano Shuho, would you still write that?
Rin
Would you face the ugly, horrible person that he was?

As I stand there stunned looking back at her, tears begin welling in her eyes.

At that moment, I realize.

In her mind, that man that rejected reality and chose to die and me overlap. She sees him in me.

She realized that the words I was writing weren't coming from my heart when she read the Ginkgo story.

I stare back at her, without saying a word.
Rin
I'm still trapped by my father.

Rin murmurs, as she looks over the room.
Rin
I haven't left this room. Not really.

Our gazes meet and stay locked.
Rin
I haven't taken a step outside since the day I found his body.
Arishima
Rin...
Rin
Professor...

She calls out to me, holding back tears as her voice fades.
Rin
Save me, please...
