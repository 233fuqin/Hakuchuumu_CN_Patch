I stare at the white-haired girl.

Yonagi is her name.

Her white hair and rose-colored eyes are very striking.

They don't look natural.
Kaito
She looks so much like the person who appears in my dreams...
Kaito
Is it a coincidence?
Izumo
No.
Kaito
...I figured.
Kaito
So...
Kaito
Who's running this sick experiment? Do I get to meet the person who's pulling the strings here?
Izumo
You will see them at the end.
Kaito
When I get my memories back, you mean?

Izumo bobs her head.
Kaito
Is that your answer for everything?
Kaito
Didn't you say it doesn't matter whether I believe you or not?

She nods again.
Kaito
What if I kill myself here? Maybe I'd prefer banging my head against the walls to going along with your stupid game.
Kaito
I could bite my tongue and choke on my blood.
Izumo
You have no memories. It is unlikely you are seriously thinking of ending your own life.
Kaito
I see.
Izumo
The more you dream, the farther along you'll get.
Izumo
If you want your memories back, all you have to do is sleep.
Izumo
It's much more rational than taking your own life.
Kaito
And if you're lying to me, I'm just gonna waste away and die here without knowing a thing.
Kaito
Maybe you're not really recording our dreams at all, and this is some kind of sick amusement for some rich guy watching us.

Izumo just gives me a level stare.
Kaito
I'm not saying that's what I think is happening here. I'm just saying that, if you tell me nothing, I could think the worst.
Izumo
I will prove to you that we are recording your dreams.
Kaito
How?
