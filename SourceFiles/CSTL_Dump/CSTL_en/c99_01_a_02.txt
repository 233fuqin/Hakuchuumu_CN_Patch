Kaito
A picture book?
Izumo
It seems so, yes.

I slowly approach her.

She looks up at me as I come closer.
Kaito
You're reading the picture book?
Yonagi

Kaito
Is it fun?

She nods.

Kaito
What kind of story is it?
Yonagi

Kaito
Oh?
Izumo
It seems like she's focused on the book.
Kaito
...She's just like a kid.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
