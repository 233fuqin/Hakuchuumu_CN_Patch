Sumomo
...

It's been two weeks since my teacher training began.

This painful experience ends today.

I see my reflection in the mirror.

The reflection of the same person I've seen every morning for the last two weeks.

Me, all put together in my smart suit.

My training ends today.

I just need to go to the classroom one more time and use the most monotone voice I can. Don't leave an impression on anyone.

I sit by the window just like yesterday.

Then I'll get my teaching license.

It doesn't matter if I really get a job as a teacher.

All I need is the qualification.

Then Mom's husband will finally stop making her life hard.

But...

I can't get Kanna's photo out of my mind.

...

I can't believe I'm smiling like this.

I love it.

I like this me.

I want to be like this.

If I were, I'm sure...

No matter what happened, I could overcome it.

If Mom cried again...

I could tell her that everything's gonna be okay.

I could smile and laugh for her until she stopped.

I'd be so dazzling, she'd forget what she was even crying about.

And then we'd laugh together.
Sumomo
...

Hah, that's it.

That's fine.

That's what I can do for my mom.

Whatever her partner says to her...

And whatever she feels about it...

There's no way I can influence that. I can't fix him being a douche.
Sumomo
Idiot.

I call myself out in the mirror.

I'm so stupid.

This is what happens when I try to use the brain I obviously don't have.

What's with this stupid costume?

I drop my bag by my feet.

The huge bag full of all the pretty clothes I love.

This is the last time.

I held on for today. I endured it all.

I may be stupid, but I tried damn hard.

For the last time...

It's okay if I go out in a blaze of beauty, right?

After the end of term ceremony in the gymnasium is finished, we're back in the classroom waiting for our last homeroom period.

The last moment of the last day I promised to Sumomo.

It feels like it passed by so slowly, yet so fast at the same time.

No, I think I'll go with slowly. It did drag on.

Sumomo won't have much reason to visit the garage anymore.

I look out of the window, remembering the afternoons we hung out together.

I'm still looking outside when the bell rings and the classroom door opens.

So it takes me a moment to notice something's different.

Complete silence fills the classroom.

Just like the first time I came into the room.

I turn to the podium.
Kanna
Ah...
Kanna
...

Curiously enough, I'm the one that breaks the silence in the room.

I couldn't help but voice my surprise.

Sumomo...

She heads to the podium, her long white hair fluttering as she goes.

No one in the classroom seems to understand what's going on.
Sumomo
Thank you so much for the last two weeks, everyone.
Sumomo
Oh, I'm Momonouchi, by the way.

I hear murmurs from all over the classroom.
Sumomo
I've always hated long graduation speeches a whole lot.
Sumomo
So I'm pretty much standing here not really knowing what to say to you all.
Sumomo
I mean, we're pretty much forty total strangers gathered here. I've no idea what any of you like.
Sumomo
Looking back, I sure wish we we had the chance to get to know one another better.
Sumomo
But nah. Feels like it's better not to force myself to do things I'm not used to.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
But I've met some people since I got here, and I also realized some things.

Sumomo glances my way as she says it.
Sumomo
Sometimes it's actually good to force yourself to do new stuff.
Sumomo
I'm glad I tried this out. But I've come to the conclusion that I should leave teaching to those who are better suited to it than me.

The teacher sitting at the back of the classroom is simply staring at her with his mouth hanging open. I even spy the gleam of a silver tooth inside his mouth.

I reach out and grab the camera from inside my bag.
Sumomo
Make sure you enjoy your summer break! And do your best with those entrance exams! Oh, wait. This academy doesn't have those, does it?

Sumomo glances my way.

I nod back.
Sumomo
You're incredible! All of you! Yep, I hope for only the best in your lives. And I'll go back to my weird life.
Sumomo
Let's all walk our own paths and do the best we can!

I point my camera toward the smiling Sumomo.

She notices and throws up a peace sign for me.

And I take the picture.

All the other students turn to me.

Sumomo then steps down from the podium and walks out.

I put the camera back in my bag and look out the window again.

Shortly after, the teacher at the back of the room follows her out into the corridor.

As soon as he's gone, the classroom explodes with noise.

I'm taken aback.

Is it that big of a deal how someone looks?

I imagine they would faint if they saw how Azuki looks when she wakes up.

But...

I saw something really interesting today.
Kanna
Ah...

Sumomo and the teacher from before are sitting at a table in the cafe by the entrance to the academy.
Male Teacher
What the hell are you thinking?!
Sumomo
I'm so sorry!
Male Teacher
Do you really even want to be a teacher?! You're not taking any of this seriously!
Sumomo
Nah, I just don't think it's for me after all.
Male Teacher
How many times did I tell you to write down what you want to say before class?!
Sumomo
I did kind of do that, though.
Male Teacher
And what's with that hair?
Sumomo
It's my real hair.
Male Teacher
You fucking with me?!
Sumomo
It's just my hair, geez.
Male Teacher
What kind of parents raised a mess like you?!
Sumomo
This has nothing to do with them.
Male Teacher
It does, you dumb bimbo. Everything that's wrong with people comes from their upbringing.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
...

He's scolding her so loudly I can hear every word even from over here.

Does he really need to go off on her here of all places?

It's a public space, and there are people around.

I mean, I can't deny that Sumomo's classes were a complete mess.

And it's true she can be a little brazen, not to mention scatterbrained.

And above all, she's dumb enough to throw everything away right before the finish line.

But it still makes me so mad.

She should talk back, but she's just sitting there taking his bullshit.
Kanna
...

Before I even realize what I'm doing, I'm walking up to her.
Kanna
...Miss Sumomo.
Sumomo
Huh?

Both of them turn to me.
Kanna
You kept your promise, didn't you?
Sumomo
Promise?
Kanna
I came back to the academy for the last week, just like you promised him.
Kanna
You should remind him of that.
Kanna
You were told to bring me in, right?
Kanna
And you were told that you'd get your license if I came back to class, right?
Sumomo
...
Kanna
Make him keep his end of the bargain.
Male Teacher
Hey, Amei, that's now how you talk to your teachers.
Kanna
I'm not talking to you.
Male Teacher
Huh?
Kanna
Imagine dumping your responsibilities on Sumomo because you can't be bothered to do your job.
Male Teacher
You...
Kanna
Sumomo kept her promise, didn't she? That has nothing to do with what she looks like.

After I finish saying my part to the slack-jawed teacher, I turn to Sumomo again.
Kanna
You better get what's yours. Make sure you didn't endure looking and feeling like crap for nothing.
Kanna
Now that you actually have the guts to be who you are...
Kanna
There's nothing else to fear, right?
Sumomo
Ahahahah!

Turning my back on them, I head straight for the exit.

That sure was something.

Kanna totally took me by surprise.

He was so childish when we were in the garage.

Where did that come from?

Is he actually secretly some kinda bad boy?

I watch him walk away.

He used to look so small, but now...

...

My heartbeat quickens.

It's thumping so hard.

Ah...

This might be kinda bad.

Kanna...

I think I'm falling for you.

I doubt you care much about that kind of thing, though.

So I'm into a younger guy, huh?

He's not that much younger, though.

He's finally out of view.

Only then do I realize that the guy on the other side of the table is yelling so loud it almost leaves me deaf on one ear.

Oh, right. I was in the middle of getting yelled at again.

He sounds even angrier than before.

Geez. Kanna sure doesn't think things through. He just made this mess then left me to deal with it.

I stand up and bow as low as I can.
Sumomo
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry about everything!
Male Teacher
...
Sumomo
I'm sorry!

Good, he shut up already.

These prideful types who want nothing more than to feel superior to everyone are so easy to deal with.

I bet he didn't expect me to actually go and put myself down.

If we were back in my old job, I could get at least three bottles out of this sucker.

That's what you get for looking down on a bitch with experience.

Well then.

From today on, I'll do what I want and be the me I wanna be.

And the first thing my heart is telling me to do...

...is to chase after Kanna!
