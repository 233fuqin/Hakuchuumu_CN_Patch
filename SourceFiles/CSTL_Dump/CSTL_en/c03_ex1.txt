Sumomo
Hey, hey! Kanna!
Sumomo
So, uh, about the cam I borrowed the other day...
Kanna
Cam?
Kanna
Ah, the one you took on that girls-only camping trip with Azuki? How did that go?
Sumomo
Oh, it was just dandy!
Kanna
You're giving it to Azuki for her channel, right? She's doing her own editing?
Sumomo
I wonder. I think she uploaded her first video today.
Kanna
Oh! Let's watch it!
Sumomo
Err, I wanted to talk about something before we watched the video.
Kanna
Azuki Channel... 'Camping with the girls,' huh? Gotta be this one... Whoa!
Sumomo
What's wrong?!
Kanna
She uploaded it today, right?! It has over three hundred thousand views!
Sumomo
For real?!
Kanna
Look!
Azuki
It's recording?
Sumomo
You bet!
Azuki
Aloha! Azuki here! Remember to like and subscribe, kiddos!
Sumomo
Like and subscribe!
Kanna
Isn't that a bit early? Don't people usually do that at the end of the video?
Sumomo
Azuki says you've gotta be a trailblazer to make it on the internet.
Kanna
Really?
Azuki
Today we bring you this! Look at this view!
Sumomo
Are you sure about this? It's just a forest, isn't it?
Azuki
Ah, shut up! A good view is a good view! Doesn't it feel good to be here?! It's about the vibe! Breathe in that clean air!
Sumomo
We sprayed so much insect spray that I can't smell anything else.
Azuki
The hell are you here for?! To bomb my video?! You damn bitch!
Sumomo
Yeah, yeah! Just let me take care of the camera! Oh, my name's Momonouchi Sumomo, by the way! I'm your camera lady today!
Sumomo
I'm a beautician by day, and I work with Azuki at filming locations. Married, by the way! So no funky business in the comments, boys!
Azuki
No one's gonna thirst over a hag like you, geez.
Sumomo
Forget about me and keep the video going!
Azuki
Yeah, yeah! Anyway, we have a talky cam today so...
Sumomo
Azuki! Say it properly! Camera!
Azuki
Who the heck cares?! God, you and the pipsqueak are such a pain in the ass sometimes!
Sumomo
So we're having a ladies-only camping trip this weekend!
Azuki
What she said! No boys allowed!
Sumomo
Oh, fire! You're totes good at camping, huh?
Azuki
Well, naturally! I used to camp a lot back in the day. Wanted to light fires really bad, you know how it is.
Sumomo
Ah, I see. So it wasn't because you wanted to drive cars?
Azuki
Cars are fun no matter what you do with them. No need to go camping for that.
Sumomo
Mm...
Azuki
You got a license yet, Peach?
Sumomo
Nope! Seems like a drag, so I never bothered.
Azuki
Nah, it's easy! You can just drive an automatic and it practically drives itself.
Sumomo
But what about the accelerator? Don't you gotta step on that and the breaks? You also have to turn the wheel, right?
Sumomo
And you gotta press the thing that goes all flashy when you turn, right?
Azuki
That's the blinkers. You don't need to vocalize.
Sumomo
And you also gotta turn on the thing that wipes the glass when it rains, right?
Azuki
The wipers, yeah.
Sumomo
No way! Too much stuff to do. It's not my thing.
Azuki
You do a lot more than that fixing up someone's hair, if you ask me. You know, the whole thing where you grab someone's hair and slather butter on it.
Sumomo
Butter? Ah, you mean the hair wax?
Azuki
Yeah, that thing.
Sumomo
You sure you're a model, Azuki? Like, you're a top model!
Azuki
Thanks.
Sumomo
How do you not remember what hair wax is? If you keep saying stuff like that, kids are gonna start copying it! You can't spread misinformation like that!
Azuki
Huh? You mean butter's not good for your hair?
Sumomo
Are you stupid?! It'd make it sooo greasy, probably!
Kanna
I don't think this has anything to do with camping.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Agreed!
Azuki
Well, that's one fire started. Let's get cooking.
Sumomo
Aye! What do we roast first?
Azuki
The bananas.
Sumomo
Bananas?! Excuse me?! You wanna roast bananas?!
Azuki
They're damn good. You didn't know?
Sumomo
Like hell I know! Don't we have meat or marshmallows? We're camping!
Azuki
Pfft, that's weak sauce. You get bored of marshmallows in like, two days!
Azuki
Bananas are forever, you broad!
Sumomo
I'll get tired of baked bananas after just one!
Azuki
Stop being a baby about it!
Sumomo
Okay, I get it! Let's roast the damn bananas, but let me roast something else too!
Azuki
No can do. I only packed bananas.
Sumomo
What?
Azuki
Look here.
Sumomo
Are you a damn monkey?!
Azuki
That was uncalled for!
Sumomo
You gotta be kidding me! How do you only bring bananas on a camping trip?!
Azuki
What else do you need?! Besides, Japanese monkeys eat potatoes, not bananas, you airhead! We don't grow bananas here!
Sumomo
Then you're worse than a monkey!
Azuki
Ah shut up! You're just stupid! Dumb bimbo!
Sumomo
Monkey!
Azuki
Let me tell you about bananas! They don't grow here in Japan, so you gotta breed them specially or import them! They're an achievement of science! Japanese bananas are the best!
Sumomo
Ahahah! The monkey's defending bananas now!
Azuki
Well you're not getting your hands on a single one of these, you hear me?!
Sumomo
No, no! Let me have one! I'll be a monkley too! Ook ook! See?
Azuki
Ook!
Kanna
Looks like you had fun.
Sumomo
It was a blast!
Sumomo
But Azuki really needs to get real. I mean, bringing only bananas to camp out?
Sumomo
Oh, this is good! Roasted bananas rock!
Azuki
Heheh, didn't I tell you?
Sumomo
They're good, and super soft! Gimme another!
Azuki
Who's the monkey now, eh?
Sumomo
You evolved enough to use fire! I'm loving it!
Azuki
You still poking fun at me?!
Sumomo
Another!
Azuki
It's good, ain't it? You see it now?
Sumomo
You bet I do!
Azuki
Bananas are all you need, right?
Sumomo
Nah, I would have liked meat, still. I don't think bananas go too well with booze.
Azuki
Damn, you got pissy when you became a housewife! Don't eat my bananas! You ought to apologize to the banana god!
Sumomo
Ahahah! Who the heck is that?! You worship phallic objects now?
Azuki
Ah, shut up! That's all you can think of when you hear about bananas?! Get your head out of the gutter!
Kanna
It's nice to see you two fooling around like always.
Sumomo
We just become little kids when we hang out together, huh?
Sumomo
I'm getting tired, Azuki! Let's switch places!
Azuki
What? You wanna give me the cam?
Sumomo
It's not a... Whatever! Just take it!
Azuki
You don't have to hold it up like a dummy, do you? Don't you have a tripod?
Sumomo
It's too heavy!
Azuki
Just leave it there. It's gonna record anyway.
Sumomo
Thanks! Okay, let's put you on this rock. There you go.
Kanna
Huh? You didn't use a tripod? Was the camera okay?
Sumomo
...
Sumomo
Does this get the shot okay?
Sumomo
Ah, that's cool! Now we can get me in the shot too! Hello there! Sumomo here!
Azuki
Come over here, Peaches. Your banana's gonna get burned.
Sumomo
Ah, coming!
Azuki
Ah!
Sumomo
Ah! Crap... I didn't like that sound.
Azuki
Did it break?
Sumomo
Looks like that. Oh man, Kanna's gonna be so mad.
Azuki
Ah crap! Did we lose all the footage?!
Sumomo
I think it recorded everything up until now. Can you check?
Azuki
Sure, lemme get the computer real quick.
Sumomo
Just make sure you cut the part where it breaks, okay?
Azuki
Right on!
Sumomo
Damn her... I told her to cut that!
Kanna
Ah, but it did record it all.
Sumomo
S-Sorry for breaking your cam...
Kanna
The camera, you mean.
Sumomo
Ah, right. I'm really sorry for that, Canna...
Kanna
Kanna, you mean.
Sumomo
Oh, yeah...
Kanna
Just make sure you take the tripod next time. I'd like to do some banana camping too sometime.
Sumomo
The roasted bananas were actually pretty good! I'll make you some to apologize, okay? I saw how Azuki made them!
Kanna
We haven't been able to go camping lately, now that I think about it. We gotta use Hachimaru more. I mean, Azuki was kind enough to give it back and all.
Kanna
Okay, let's go this weekend!
Sumomo
Yippee! Good thing I broke the camera!
Kanna
Sumomo.
Sumomo
Ah... Sorry. Too much info, right?
Kanna
You meant cam?
Sumomo
Oh my god!
