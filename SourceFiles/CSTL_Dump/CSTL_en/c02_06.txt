Hamlet
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
Hamlet
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
Hamlet
To die—to sleep, no more, and by as sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
Hamlet
'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream!
Hamlet
Ay, there's the rub. For in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause...

Today is Hamlet's premiere.

The theater's atmosphere couldn't be more different from the premiere of A Midsummer Night's dream.

All the seats are filled.

Both the second and third floor as well.

I hear that our plays have become something of a hot topic among the aristocracy.

However...

The theater, as full as it is, is as quiet as can be.

Every person there is on the edge of their seat, their attention focused on Olivia's performance as Hamlet.

They're silent, but enraptured.

Silent, but receptive.

A mysterious air hangs over her debut.
Hamlet
Thou livest; report me and my cause alright. In this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, to tell my story. Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause.
Hamlet
I cannot live to hear the news from England. On you, he has my dying voice.
Hamlet
The rest, is silence...

Hamlet's quest for revenge culminates in him losing the woman he loved, his mother, and his own life as he succumbs to poison most vile.

If I didn't get this story out of my system, perhaps that would be me right now.

I can see myself in there.

My very own ghost, overlapping with the Hamlet on the stage.

Perhaps everyone in this theater has felt like this at one point in their lives.

Hamlet dies in the arms of his trusted friend, Horatio, and the curtain falls.

There is a moment of silence...

Before a rapturous cheer like none I've ever heard reaches us in the wings.
Olivia
I am glad to see my cute little playwright wasn't a flash in the pan.
Will
Of course. Need I remind you I sold scripts before A Midsummer Night's Dream?
Olivia
But the play that made your name famous was that very one. The credit goes to my troupe.
Olivia
And I see you're getting used to greeting the public at the end of the plays. Getting used to our popularity, are we?
Will
Well, it seems to make the audience happy.

I ascend to the empty stage in response to the persistent cheers.

I've gotten used to this too.

And I'm no longer so excited I'm trembling, the way I was on that first day.

There's something a little sad about that, but I like the feeling that I'm gaining confidence as a writer.
Kiki
Will?

I hear Kiki's voice from behind the curtain and turn back.
Kiki
You have a visitor.
Will
Huh? Who? If it's a critic, tell them to go away. They're free to spread whatever bollocks they want.
Kiki
But they said they know you?
Will
Me?
Marlowe
Salutations, William Shakespeare.
Will
Ah, it's you.

Marlowe is waiting for me as I exit the wings and step out into the auditorium.

Oh, right. I'm supposed to be having a contest with him.

At first, I'd channeled my regret over Ed's death into a desire to enact revenge against this man.

But now, all of my time and effort is going towards protecting Olivia.

To be honest, I really have no time to entertain this pompous toad.
Marlowe
It looks like you're doing well. Word has reached even my ears.
Marlowe
I never knew this troupe had such a remarkable actor. He commands the stage well. Is he the leader?
Will
...Thanks for the praise, I suppose.

I realize he's talking about Olivia.

I suppose, as a fellow creator, he would see through the diversion of Kiki.
Marlowe
And I see your wounds have healed as well.
Will
You came to bring up that old stuff? I'm acting, and I'm quite well, thank you.

As I say that, I'm actually surprised it's been less than a month since the last time I saw Marlowe.

Since then, my life has consisted of rehearsing Hamlet while performing A Midsummer Night's Dream, with nights spent writing my new play.

So much has happened that the person I was back then feels like a stranger now.

Still, my grief over Ed's death has not faded.

I still feel the pain, but I no longer feel inclined to channel it into a rivalry with this man.
Marlowe
You've gained an audience, indeed, but it doesn't seem like the critics are quite so enthusiastic about your works. Why do you suppose that is?
Will
I couldn't care less.
Marlowe
Well, let me tell you. Your pretty words might deceive the common rabble, but they can't fool experts with a discerning eye.
Marlowe
Don't go presuming you're closer to a court performance for the achievement of filling up this paltry theater.
Will
You came here to tell me that? You must not have much to do.
Marlowe
I—
Will
Look, I'm past all this with you now.
Will
I don't care if critics want to trash our work to make themselves look smart.
Will
I don't care if you want to find fault with me either. Why not go ahead and write a play about it, eh?
Marlowe
Do not misjudge me, Shakespeare. I would never use my work in such a petty manner.
Will
Well, if you have such high standards about your plays...
Will
Why not write them yourself, Marlowe?
Marlowe
You accuse me falsely, sir.

I let out a sigh.
Will
Sorry, I need go write my new play. I've no time for more of these mock duels with you.
Marlowe
You run from me, William Shakespeare? But remember your oath. Whoever is not selected for the court performance will give up writing.
Will
Yeah, I remember. Let's call it off.

Marlowe's eyes widen.
Marlowe
Hahah... Ahahahah! Lost your nerve, have you, William Shakespeare?
Will
No, I intend to keep my promise. If I lose, I give up writing.

If my writing is weak enough to lose to this swine, then I have no hope of protecting Olivia.

If that happens, I'll need to think of some other way.

It's more important for me to protect her than to keep writing works for my own ego.
Will
But if you lose, I won't require you to give up your quill.
Marlowe
What?
Will
Your words have lost all relevance anyway. You came here because, on some level, you know that.
Will
Besides, in a way, you've already given up the quill. Cry false accusations all you want, but you can't hide from the truth.
Marlowe
You've become quite adept at running your mouth.
Will
So feel free to write again if it ever strikes your fancy. It doesn't matter to me either way.
Marlowe
This is an affront, William Shakespeare.
Will
You don't have to say my full name every time.

Marlowe's really glaring at me now.
Will
Are we done here? I'm busy writing my new play, and time is too precious to waste. Don't make me say it again.
Marlowe
Things won't go your way here, William Shakespeare.

Marlowe leaves, his eyes burning with hatred.

It's not as if my hatred for him has simply vanished into the ether.

But at one point, I wanted to gain enough fame to drown out his name and erase him from history.

And now...

Something else fills my heart. A drive to keep this troupe alive and well.

Besides, given that little display he put on just now, I'd say that my mission as it pertains him is complete.

So, I'll set all thoughts of him aside...

And direct all my attention to the new script.
Will
If he marries Juliet, Tybalt will be his cousin, right?
Will
So he resolves not to fight like he usually would.
Will
But obviously, Romeo is the only one that has had a change of heart.
Will
The younger members of the Montague and Capulet families escalate the conflict.
Olivia
Right.
Will
This is the second tragedy that befalls Romeo.
Olivia
Second? What was the first?
Will
Why, the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets itself.
Olivia
Ah, I see.
Will
And then, Tybalt Capulet pierces the heart of Romeo's best friend with his blade.
Will
His friend is killed, right in front of his eyes.
Will
And he...

Romeo loses his friend because of a meaningless feud between the two houses.

I can imagine the scene as if I were there.

As I explain the events of the scene, and Romeo's mindset...

All the memories, the sorrow of the day I watched Ed die, come rushing back to me.
Will
...
Olivia
Will.

Olivia rests her hand on mine.

Only then do I realize that my hands are shaking.
Olivia
It's okay. It's not your story. This is happening to Romeo Montague.
Will
Yeah.
Olivia
Think you can write it?

I nod.

She smiles and lets go of my hand.
Will
The moment he sees his friend struck down in front of him, he is overtaken by a deep hatred.
Will
All feelings of love desert him, even Juliet's memory leaves his mind...
Will
And he stabs Tybalt dead.
Will
That's the second tragedy.
Olivia
You should take a break. I know you're tired.
Will
Mmh, yeah. I think I will.
Olivia
That man came by today, didn't he?
Will
Who?
Olivia
Marlowe.
Will
Ah, yeah.
Will
I don't know what he really wanted, though.
Olivia
To study the enemy, of course. Not even the Admiral's Men can afford to ignore us anymore.
Olivia
It's extremely out of character for Marlowe to come to a rival theater himself. Unprecedented, really.
Olivia
I think the disdain you showed him was unprecedented, too.
Will
Oh, you were listening?
Olivia
We could hear you two in the wings. We lost our bloody minds.
Will
If I wasn't so tired, I might have sparred a little longer.
Olivia
Getting confident, are we?
Olivia
This is a duel between us and the Admiral's Men.
Will
Mm...
Will
We'll win. There is no theatergoer in town that would rather watch someone else's plays over ours.
Olivia
But you have to give up writing if we're not selected for the court performance, right? And you're not holding Marlowe to the same?
Will
What point would there be in writing plays for a country where even the queen is blind?
Will
If it comes to that, I'll just look for another way to protect you.
Olivia
That's my boy.

Olivia gently brings her hands to my cheeks and plants a kiss on my lips.
Olivia
Of course, we're getting that court performance.
Will
I know. We'll become the Lord Chamberlain's men and change the law.

Olivia smiles at me blissfully.
Olivia
And it's more than that. The court is a beautiful stage. A stage worthy of our talents.
Olivia
I will perform your play about true love atop the most beautiful, brightest stage in the whole world.
Olivia
What greater joy could there be?
Will
You...
Will
You really were born for the stage.

She smiles and brings her lips close to mine.
Olivia
Of course I was. Did you only just realize?
Will
Actually...
Will
I've known since the day we met.
Olivia
Good boy.

Again, she presses her lips to mine.

Then she slowly breaks the kiss.
Olivia
But don't let your guard down.
Will
What?
Olivia
You told Marlowe you were writing a new play, didn't you? He may attempt to steal the script, or perhaps interfere with the performance itself.
Olivia
Our scripts are the most important things to our troupe, almost as precious as our lives.

I can't help but chuckle.
Olivia
What's so funny?
Will
A month ago, you'd have told me the scripts were more precious than our lives.

Olivia glares at me.
Olivia
Stop talking nonsense and start writing already.
Will
All right, ma'am.
Will
So, Romeo kills Tybalt, and...

I'm seated at my desk.

In his fury, Romeo sends his blade through the chest of Tybalt, a member of the Capulets.

Romeo is driven from Verona. Juliet, in her grief, searches for a way to be with him.

But...
Will
It's no good.

When I mutter to myself, Olivia takes her eyes off the first half of the draft to look at me.
Olivia
What's wrong?
Will
I can't write.
Olivia
...
Will
There's no way they can end up together.
Will
If I write the story to its natural conclusion, they both end up dead.
Olivia
That's how the original draft went, right? It's fine.
Will
But...

I look up at her.

Our eyes meet.

My muse, the basis for Juliet, is right in front of me.
Olivia
I am not Juliet, and you are not Romeo.

Romeo is banished from the city after killing Tybalt.

Still, Juliet's love for him endures, and she drinks a potion that will let her appear dead, long enough to free her to be with him.

She sends her beloved Romeo a letter explaining her plan, but...
Will
I still can't kill them.
Olivia
Calm down. You're getting too invested.
Will
...
Olivia
Why not save it for tomorrow?
Will
Yeah, sorry.
Will
I know I need to finish this.
Will
I know that, but...

Hamlet's premiere was today.

Truth is, we should have begun rehearsing for Romeo and Juliet today too.
Will
I'll finish it tomorrow.
Olivia
All right, let's just take more time to rehearse Hamlet tomorrow. You can skip work at the pub too.
Will
But I—
Olivia
Your time should be spent writing, not washing cups. This is your leader's order.
Will
All right.
Olivia
Let's go to bed for tonight, okay?
Will
Okay.

Olivia regards the audience with a beaming smile when the play is over.

But that smile is gone the moment she steps backstage.

She closes one eye and her face twists in pain as grips her left wrist.
Will
Olivia?
Olivia
I'm fine, it's just a little cut. Bring me a dressing.

When she lets go of her arm, I see blood seeping into her costume.
Will
Hey now!
Kiki
Oh, whoa!

Kiki quickly prepares a dressing and wraps it around her arm.
Olivia
It's okay, just a shallow cut. It's not like we put real poison on the blades.

Olivia laughs lightly.

The last scene of Hamlet features a swordfight.

Hamlet's arm is sliced by the tip of a poisoned saber, which leads to his death.
Will
But...
Olivia
Injuries come with the territory. Don't get spooked by a little cut.

Olivia looks up at me.
Olivia
Didn't I say the responsibility is mine?
Will
R-Right.
Kiki
We need to change you out of that costume. It's all bloody. Thomas, can we get another one like this?
Thomas
You need but ask.
Olivia
A clean one this time. I don't want to stink.
Thomas
...
Olivia
Well, say something!
Thomas
As clean as possible, understood.
Kiki
Hey, Will. Do you remember that man from the Admiral's Men who came by yesterday?
Will
Hm?
Thomas
Marlowe, right? He's here again.
Will
Again?
Kiki
He brought more people today.
Thomas
And they don't seem to want to leave.
Will
Huh?
Kiki
Maybe they're waiting for the theater to empty out. I don't think they're trying to ambush us, though.
Will
Really, don't they have anything better to do?
Kiki
I did hear the Lily Theater has had a lot of empty seats these days.

Thomas nods at Kiki's words.
Thomas
The lads that help me make the tickets mentioned that.
Kiki
But what else would you expect? The best plays in town are right here.

Kiki and Thomas giggle together.
Will
I see. So he brought along some actors from the Admiral's Men today, huh?
Kiki
Possibly.
Will
We should be cautious, just in case.
Will
Let's take the strongbox with us today. Our earnings have been increasing a lot.
Will
Losing money would be bad, but losing a script would be much worse.
Kiki
Mhm, indeed.
Will
Are you going to be making tickets today, Thomas?
Thomas
We wouldn't have enough if I didn't. Even though we make a lot every day!
Kiki
What about the new play? We started practicing for Hamlet before the second showing of A Midsummer Night's dream, so I assumed we'd see it today.
Will
I've hit a little block. It's not done quite yet.
Kiki
Oh, sorry to hear it.

After making sure that all the audience have left the theater, Olivia and I head to the pub.
Olivia
You feel up for writing today?
Will
Mm? Yeah.
Will
I have to, yes.
Olivia
The audience was cheering again today. I feel like the plays are really touching them.
Olivia
We can polish up the first draft together, so just focus on getting it done.
Olivia
Just let it pour out, like you're humming to yourself.
Will
Yeah, I'll get it done.
Olivia
Say...
Will
Mm?
Olivia
Is that the strongbox from the theater you're carrying?
Will
Yeah.
Will
Apparently, the Admiral's Men came around today with Marlowe. I don't know what they're up to, so I thought this would be prudent.
Olivia
He came again?
Will
It seems they're having trouble filling seats in their theater.
Olivia
The Lily?

I nod.

Olivia's expression becomes a mix of astonishment and glee.
Olivia
They're losing customers? That's unprecedented. If it's true, then this is history in the making.
Will
Yeah, Thomas heard about it from his friends.
Olivia
So rumors are already spreading.
Will
Huh?
Olivia
There's nothing nobles love quite like rumors. It's possible this one has already reached Queen Elizabeth's ears.
Olivia
If they hear about us as a troupe capable of stealing an audience from the Admiral's Men, the court performance is as good as ours.

Olivia rattles on excitedly, but behind her...
Will
It's not just a rumor, Olivia. It's very clear that the Lily Theater's actors have nothing better to do with their time.
Olivia
Huh?

Olivia looks behind her, following my gaze.

There stands Marlowe, surrounded by his cronies.
Will
I don't quite see what you hope to accomplish by harassing me, Marlowe.
Will
Picking fights with me won't get you any closer to the court performance. If you have time to hang around our theater, I suggest—
Marlowe
...
Will
...

The usually talkative Marlowe remains silent, his gaze fixed on a particular spot.

Olivia's left hand.
Olivia
...

As always, Olivia takes care not to speak in front of him.
Marlowe
Are you wounded, fair damsel?
Olivia
...?!

Marlowe is staring at the dressing peeking out from under her cuff.
Marlowe
Are you all right? Were you cut?
Marlowe
By a saber coated in poison, perhaps?

Olivia smiles at him.

An abstruse smile that neither affirms nor denies.
Will
Sadly, she got that cut at the pub.
Marlowe
Is that so?
Will
Wanna come for a drink? I'll hear out your woes about your lost audience. I could even give you some advice.
Marlowe
I believe I'll have to pass on your kind offer. I'd rather not take my custom to a pub where Catholics gather.
Will
Excuse me?
Marlowe
And I have urgent business that needs attending to. Your offer is tempting, but I'll have to decline.
Will
Hah, okay.

I take Olivia's hand and lead her away from Marlowe.
Marlowe
Shakespeare.

Marlowe leaves with a confident grin.
Marlowe
...See you tomorrow.
Will
...

Marlowe leaves, a disgusting grin plastered across his face.
Will
...
Olivia
...

In the end, I work my shift in the pub together with Olivia.

Olivia's wound is close to her hand, so I want to handle the washing myself.

When the customers leave and my dad goes upstairs, we sit for a while in silence together.
Olivia
Tomorrow...
Will
Mm?
Olivia
Let's explain the situation to everyone. We can't let them go on stage without telling them and risk having them walk into a trap.
Will
Okay. But we don't know that we've truly been found out just yet.
Will
And even if we have, he may just want to try and extort us.
Will
If all he wants is money, then that's easy enough to deal with. We just need to get more people into the theater.
Olivia
True...
Will
Are you gonna perform tomorrow?

Olivia looks into my eyes.

I return her gaze with my own.
Olivia
I want to.
Olivia
We can't stop here. If we do...

She turns her eyes down.
Olivia
I won't know what my life has been for anymore.
Olivia
So long as I'm still able, I want to stand on the stage.
Will
Olivia.

She raises her head.

I see the pain and uncertainty in her eyes.
Will
This is your troupe. Did we ever have a rule that said women can't perform?
Olivia
...
Will
If you want to do it, go ahead. It's your choice.
Will
As to whether or not the other members will join you on the stage...
Will
They will have to decide that for themselves.
Will
Perform if you want to. I'm writing these plays so that you can shine up there.
Olivia
...All right.
Olivia
Thank you.

The whole troupe is gathered for practice as usual.

Not one person is late.

I'm just realizing how organized the troupe has gotten in just a month.
Kiki
So today's the third day since we premiered Hamlet, huh?
Thomas
It's about time for a comedy, I'd say.

Our troupe is the only thing the theater world is talking about too.

Olivia and I exchange glances.

Seeing that she's a little nervous, I give her a reassuring nod.
Olivia
Everyone.
Kiki
Oh?
Thomas
What, are you going to get all lovey dovey in front of us again?
Kiki
You think they'll tell us about their first time or something?
Olivia
It's possible that Marlowe discovered our secret yesterday.
Kiki
Secret?

Kiki tilts his head in puzzlement.
Thomas
And that would be?
Will
I know what you mean. We're so used to it, it's easy to forget.

Kiki and Thomas look at each other.
Olivia
He saw the wound I got while playing Hamlet yesterday.

Kiki and Thomas look down at her hand.
Kiki
He saw the dressing on your hand?

Olivia nods.
Kiki
Is it my fault?
Olivia
No, it's not. I was just careless. I should have noticed when I changed.
Olivia
And what's more, I was the one in charge of the rehearsals. If I'd spent more time on the swordplay, this wouldn't have happened.
Olivia
I was also the one who imposed that strict deadline. If anyone's responsible for this, it's me.
Olivia
I don't want any of you to blame yourselves.

Olivia looks into the eyes of all the troupe members who had sparring practices with her.
Kiki
But are we acting without you? Can we even do that?
Thomas
Nah, not a chance in hell.
Kiki
I figured.
Olivia
We don't have Spencer's support anymore, so we can't afford to cancel the performance if we want to keep the troupe alive.
Olivia
I will perform on stage today, but...
Olivia
You all are well aware of what happens to troupes that allow women to perform, don't you?
Kiki
Yeah, we know.
Thomas
But we were all petty thieves or worse before coming here.
Kiki
If you're going up on stage, I am too.
Olivia
...
Will
Have you given any thought as to what would happen if we're caught?
Kiki
Yeah.
Thomas
You know we used to be petty thieves, lad.
Kiki
Besides, remember what the leader said.
Kiki
I'm the main attraction.

Olivia turns a silent, tremulous gaze to Kiki.
Kiki
I will be with you on stage.
Thomas
Former thieves we may be, but now we're slaves.

Kiki doesn't go along with Thomas' joking remark. Instead, he shakes his head.
Kiki
No, we're actors now. And the actors of this troupe will act!
Thomas
Yeah, I'm with you.
Olivia
Kiki's right.
Olivia
You are not my slaves anymore.
Olivia
And, freed from any obligation...

Olivia trails off, searching for the right words.

All the members of the troupe wait patiently for her to continue.
Olivia
...Will you stand with me on the stage?
Kiki
Aye, ma'am.
Thomas
Imagine being so popular the competition has to sabotage your performance, eh? I could boast about it for my whole life.
Will
That's a good way to put it.

Everyone heads into the wings and sets about preparing for the show.

Olivia watches them go.
Will
They're a treasure, aren't they?
Olivia
...Mhm.

Olivia nods.
Will
I wouldn't trade one of them for the world.
Olivia
Mhm.
Olivia
I'm so proud of them all.
Will
Let's get ready.

...
Hamlet
Today's our third performance of Hamlet.

Every single one of us chose to stand on stage alongside Olivia.

Her calm voice resonates throughout the theater.

The audience is quiet once more.

They're fully absorbed in the world we've created.

They're enraptured listening to Olivia's lines.

Until the main door of the theater bursts open, so loud that we can hear it backstage.
Police Officer
Nobody move!
Will
It's them.
Kiki
The watchmen! They're really here!
Thomas
Marlowe's reached a new low, eh?
Kiki
Or we've risen too high.

A group of watchmen trample their way in.
Police Officer
Hey, you!

One of them bellows at Olivia, who's standing in the center of the stage.
Police Officer
Take off the hat, and show your face.
Olivia
...

I run out onto the stage.

If I keep her behind me, maybe we can talk our way out of this.
Police Officer
Hey! Don't move!

The pack of watchmen rush the stage.
Olivia
Will, it's fine.
Will
...

Beneath the hat, she's smiling.

Olivia turns to face the audience.

I also look ahead.

I see Marlowe leaning against a wall by the entrance.

He waves at me with a smirk on his face.

I grit my teeth.

He'd really go this far?

He wants recognition from the stupid court that badly?

Still...

The fact is, we came here knowing the risk.

Olivia puts her hand to the hat that hides her hair and face.

Then she gracefully removes it.
Police Officer
You're a woman, right?
Olivia
I think that should be plainly obvious.
Olivia
Have you ever seen a man this beautiful before?
Police Officer
Seize them all.

Olivia looks down at the flustered officers trying to storm their way onto the stage with a confident smile.

Then, she slowly turns to face me.
Olivia
I'm sorry for dragging you down, Will.
Olivia
But... we had good times.
Will
What are you—

One of the watchmen grabs her by the arm.

She makes no effort to resist.

They begin to storm the wings as well.
Will
Get your hands off her, you filthy cur!

Before I can even finish shouting at the man, I'm restrained by two of them.

Two watchmen just for me? Really?

It should be pretty obvious I'm not that strong.

This is definitely overkill.

The theater is in a state of pandemonium, a total reversal from the silence during Hamlet.

As they press me to the ground, I look up at Olivia.

She's gazing at the theater with melancholy eyes.

All I can do is stare at her.

I hear Kiki raise his voice in protest from the wings.

It sounds like Thomas is bashing some heads in.

I can't help but smile.

Olivia looks down at me.

She's also smiling in disbelief.

We're tied up, rounded up, and put onto carts.

I know where we're being taken.

The prison with with one entrance and no exit—the Clink.

The place where Ed was imprisoned.

The room I'm thrown into is completely bare.

It's a small, single occupancy gaol cell.

The watchman who threw me onto the floor leaves, and a while later, a familiar man comes in.

I try to remember where I've seen him before.

And in a moment, I realize.

That day...

That town's constable, who was chatting with Marlowe while Ed was apprehended.
Chief of Police
So you are William Shakespeare, I assume. The playwright who's the talk of the town.
Will
My reputation precedes me, I suppose.
Chief of Police
You've come far for a little bartender rat.

I look up at the man.

He looks down at me with a grin.
Will
You know an awful lot about me.
Chief of Police
I fear you underestimate us, lad. You were connected to that missionary, weren't you?
Chief of Police
He frequented your pub, I hear.
Chief of Police
But it seems like you changed occupations as of late.

The constable continues to bare his teeth in an unnaturally wolfish grin.
Will
What are you trying to say?
Chief of Police
You have fun acting, eh?
Chief of Police
Made your fair share of friends?
Will
...

When I don't answer, the constable slowly casts his gaze over the tiny cell.
Chief of Police
This place stinks, doesn't it?
Will
Funny you mention that. I thought it was your breath stinking up the place.
Chief of Police
Hahahah!

After a throaty laugh, the constable grabs me by the cheeks.

He presses them into my face so hard my teeth bite into the soft flesh of my mouth.
Chief of Police
Better watch your mouth. You'll lose most of your sass after three days in this place anyway. I'm not here to play games with you.
Will
...

While holding my face in an iron grip, he brings his own in closer.

I can see the rows of yellowed teeth grinning at me.
Chief of Police
I'll be merciful and give you a choice. You have the power to save your little friends.
Chief of Police
No one cares about arresting some woman in drag.
Will
...
Chief of Police
I just owe Marlowe some favors, nothing personal.
Chief of Police
If he wants me to grab someone and throw him in the gaol, I do it. A crime's a crime.
Chief of Police
But what I want isn't little ham actor scoundrels like you and your lot.
Will
...
Chief of Police
I don't give a rat's arse about these petty crimes. What I want is Catholic heads!
Chief of Police
I don't give a rat's arse about these petty crimes. What I want is bloody Catholic necks!
Chief of Police
If I can nail them, I'll ascend to the gentry too. Catholics have the only heads that really fetch a price.
Will
...

He squeezes my cheeks in even harder.
Chief of Police
I know they all gather in your little pub. When's the next reunion, eh? Are you the organizer? Or is it one of the guests?
Chief of Police
You haven't been gathering as of late, have you? Now, that's no good. Get together and pray! Have yourselves a merry little meeting!
Chief of Police
Call all the Catholics you know to that little rat hole of yours. Do that...
Chief of Police
...and I'll release all of your troupe right now. Not a bad deal, is it?
Will
...

He lets go of me.

My face feels numb.
Chief of Police
What do say you, lad?
Will
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.
Will
And the only thing that stinks here is your damn breath. It started smelling better as soon as you got out of my face.
Will
This place doesn't seem too bad to me, eh?

The constable grins again.
Chief of Police
Hey, you see that stain on the wall? Yeah, that one. The horizontal line.
Chief of Police
What do you suppose that's from?
Will
...

I can see a brown mark smudged across the stone at the spot he points to.
Chief of Police
When it rains, the Sage river goes up, you see, and it floods this room..
Chief of Police
Queen Elizabeth knows no mercy, eh? She probably built this place knowing that that happens.
Will
I agree, she probably did.
Will
She seems like a merciless woman indeed.
Chief of Police
Nothing comes free in here. Not a bed, not candles, not even food.
Chief of Police
The Queen doesn't spare resources for us to feed ham actors.
Chief of Police
You could even get out if you had enough money. Too bad you're not a noble. I sympathize there.
Chief of Police
Think hard and well. Your troupe's doing well, ain't it? My offer isn't bad.

With that, he gets up and leaves.
Will
...

I just can't do it.

I'd rather die than sell out Dad and Rob.

I let out a huge sigh.

I sit down with my back to the wall of the narrow cell.

It's over.

It's all over.

I feel the strength leaving my limbs.

Looking back on everything, it all seems like a dream.

I acted out my own scripts together with Olivia's troupe, earning rave reviews from audiences.

I shared a love with the beautiful Olivia.

Even the pub flourished.

Everything was going so well that I let my guard down about the danger inherent in Olivia’s performance.

Seems the tab for it all has come due.

But...

A limp smile appears on my face.

The thrill I've felt these last few weeks is more than most men get in a lifetime.

One lifetime won’t be enough to pay that debt in full.
Will
Hahah...
??
Well, aren't you carefree?

I hear a voice through the wall.

I stare at the wall behind me for a while.
Will
Olivia?
Will
You were listening?
Olivia
Don't make it sound like I was eavesdropping. I just happened to hear.
Will
...
Olivia
Will?
Will
I'm sorry, Olivia.
Olivia
...
Will
Selling out the pub, my dad...
Will
I just can't do it.
Will
I'm sorry.

And then, silence.

I try to picture what her expression must be on the other side of that wall.
Olivia
You were right, this isn't as bad as I imagined.
Will
...
Olivia
I went from a disgustingly huge manor, to sleeping in a seedy pub, and now a gaol cell.
Olivia
But it's really not as bad as it seems from the outside, is it?

She speaks in her usual tone.
Olivia
If I need to start begging my own slave to save my life, I'd rather die with him. I couldn't take such humiliation.
Olivia
And if you keep treating me like a damsel in distress, I'll have you hanged.
Will
Hah, okay.

At some point I've begun smiling in earnest.

A peaceful silence fills the room.
Olivia
But I do have one regret.
Will
Mm?
Olivia
I wasn't able to see your new work completed.

Realizing that Will is in the cell next to mine, I sit down and hug my knees.

I lean my back against the cold stone wall.
Olivia
We were so close.

Yes, we were close.

To everything.

So close to completing the story we'd begun.

With just a little more time, our story could have begun.

So close...
Olivia
...

So close to being with the first man I've ever loved.

I can't stand it.

I let the tears roll freely down my cheeks.

They fall soundlessly onto the stone, leaving damp little circles.
Will
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath...

I raise my face.
Will
...hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Olivia
Will?
Will
Thou art not conquer'd, beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
Will
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Olivia
...

I hear his voice through the stone walls.

It's high, for a man's voice, and sweet.

That voice that's had a grip on my heart since the moment I first head it.

Yes.

Even in death, Juliet is still beautiful.

Just like Olivia, even when her stage has been taken from her.

These are Romeo's feelings in the face of her death.

They flow out of me.

I'm a playwright, but I'm also an actor now.

I've found myself warming up to the role, all thanks to Olivia's encouragement.
Will
Romeo...
Will
News of Juliet's death reaches him before the news of her plan. And then...
Olivia
...The third tragedy.

I hear Olivia's voice through the cold stone walls.

I nod to myself.

That's right.
Will
Romeo acquires poison and goes to where Juliet is.
Will
And then...
Will
While basking in her beauty one last time, he drinks of the poison.

There is no other place for Romeo to breathe his last.

None but beside the woman he loved.

He must do it, before the cold hand of death can rob her of warmth...

And so, Romeo dies beside the body of his beloved.
Olivia
And Juliet...
Olivia
When she wakes from her induced sleep, she sees Romeo's prone form next to her.
Olivia
His body is still warm, his cheeks soft beneath her hands.
Olivia
But now, the wall of death stands between them.
Olivia
Just like this cold stone wall between us.
Will
...
Olivia
O churl... drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after?
Will
Juliet picks up the empty cup of poison and laments to herself.
Olivia
She has woken from her long sleep only to find that Romeo has gone to his.
Olivia
She sees no point in living on. Her world has lost all color.
Will
...
Olivia
She hears footsteps coming their way.
Olivia
Only a life of pain with a man she doesn't want awaits her. A life without Romeo.
Olivia
Juliet picks up his dagger and pierces her own chest with it.
Olivia
For that is the only way to be with her beloved for eternity.
Will
...And it's done.

For some reason, I'm crying.

Finally, it's done.

Olivia and I finished it together.

We created what we envisioned.

A true love story.
Olivia
Hey, Will.
Will
Yes?
Olivia
It's a masterpiece.

I let out a small chuckle.

I close my eyes and nod deeply.
Will
Yeah, it is. A masterpiece.
Olivia
I'm sure this story will keep moving people's hearts decades—no, hundreds of years from now.
Will
Yeah.
Olivia
Don't you think that perhaps we met for a reason?
Will
...
Olivia
Me, to make your talent bloom.
Olivia
And you, to bring this story about us to life.
Will
Yeah.
Olivia
It will live on in people's hearts long after we're dead and buried.
Will
...Yes.
Olivia
Make sure you write it down.
Will
What?
Olivia
The unfinished script. Promise you will write it to the end.
Olivia
That's an order.
Will
...
Olivia
We should both sleep now. Our priority should be saving our energy to survive this. This is your leader's order.
Will
But...
Olivia
Understood?
Will
All right. Tomorrow, we can think how to get out of here. There must be a way.
Olivia
...Yes.
Olivia
Good night, Will.
Will
Good night, Olivia.

The cell has a skylight.

I can see the moon through it.

A full moon.

I will never forget the sight of this moon.

No matter what the future holds.

Even if I were to look up at the moon from the arms of someone else.

It will always remind me of this day.

Of the way we spun a story about our love, together.

How, despite the wall between us, we saw the very same scene in our minds.

And...

How we created a masterpiece that will go down in history.

Two people who belong together.

Two people deserving of happiness.

Two people who strove to be together, but will never reach that happy end.

That's where the true essence of the play lies.

I'm glad I met Will.

I've no regrets.

I don't even regret standing on stage.

I'm an actress.

And I will be so to the very end.

But...
Olivia
I wanted to perform it...

That story inspired by our encounter.

At least once...

As the woman he loved...

I wanted to perform it for him.

But that wish won't come true.

The times we live in won't allow for it.

But someday...

The day will come when a woman who shares my aspirations stands proudly on the stage.

I'm sure it'll happen. It has to.

Even if centuries must pass, this story will touch people's hearts.

Because what our story shows is, without a doubt, true love.

I stare at the floor.

My tears fall without a sound.

Only the moon is witness to them.

I'm sure Will hasn't noticed.

That's fine.

I will continue to act, to play a role.

But I loved you.

I loved you, and only you.

As long as I know that, nothing else matters.

I listen closely, and hear his deep, even breathing as he sleeps.
Olivia
You really are carefree...

A smile touches my lips.

It was my own selfishness that dragged the rest of the troupe down.

I will save them all.

This is my last role as their leader.

I get up and pound on the thick wooden door.
Olivia
Warden! I need to call upon someone.
Will
...
Will
Ah!

A hard kick to the stomach wakes me up.
Will
...

The blinding light around me slowly gives way to shapes.
Will
Huh?

Right, I fell asleep.

I didn't even mean to.

The thick wooden door in front of me...

...is open.
Will
...
Warden
Get up, worm.
Will
What?!
Kiki
Will!
Will
Guys!

The warden hauls me out of the Clink. I find the rest of the troupe waiting at the entrance.
Kiki
You're safe!
Thomas
Ack, what's with these clowns? First they lock us up, and then they throw us out.
Kiki
Right? Isn't this too much of an overreaction? I mean, the only thing that happened is they found out our leader is a woman!
Kiki
So I'm okay but she's not? This country's gone to hell, I tell you.
Will
You're right. I wonder what's so abominable about a woman crossdressing.

Kiki nods, obviously dissatisfied.
Will
But we knew this would happen if word got out. Let's just count our blessings and rejoice that everyone's safe.
Thomas
The only one left in there is...

Thomas takes a look at the rest of the troupe.
Kiki
The leader, right?
Will
Let's wait. She should come out soon.
Kiki
Right.

But no matter how long we wait, Olivia never comes.
Thomas
Mmm...
Kiki
You think she may have gotten out before all of us?
Will
No... She wouldn't leave us behind.
Thomas
Then...
Kiki
I guess as the main culprit, they won't let her out so easy...

Just then, the warden pokes his head out of the tower door.
Warden
Oi, how long are you gonna stick around? You want to get thrown into a cell again?
Will
There's still one of us in there. A tall woman with white hair.
Warden
What are you going on about? She left long ago. She's the reason you're out free.
Thomas
Huh?
Kiki
What does it mean?
Will
...

The warden lets out an exasperated sigh and goes back inside.
Kiki
What's happening? Does that mean the leader is gone already?
Thomas
Maybe she just left?
Kiki
But where could she have gone to?
Will
...

...To Spencer.
Will
...
Kiki
Will?
Will
She...

She did it.

She sold herself.

To Spencer.

To save us.
Thomas
Will?

What do I do?

What can I do?

My mind is racing.

I want to run to her side right now.

But...
Kiki
Will, are you okay?
Thomas
Lad, you look as pale as a sheet.
Will
No...

I can't.

What will become of the troupe if I run off on my own?

Without a patron, they're as good as vagrants.

I would be rendering Olivia's sacrifice meaningless.

I understand.

It's possible that this was the only way.

I understand it, and yet...

I clench my trembling hands into fists.
Will
Let's go back to the theater for now. You left your clothes backstage, right?
Will
Let's go back, and then...
Will
We'll talk about what to do next.
Kiki
Yeah, let's do that for now.
Thomas
Yeah, at least we know the leader is safe now. That's good.
Will
There's something I need to do. Kiki, go to the theater with the others. Everyone's still upset from all this. Choose someone to coordinate things in the meantime.
Kiki
Huh?
Thomas
Where are you going?
Will
I'll be back soon. I'll meet you at the theater, I promise.
Kiki
O-Okay.
Thomas
See you, lad!

I leave them and run as fast as my legs can carry me.

Why, Olivia?

No, I know the answer very well.

She fulfilled her duty as the leader of the troupe.

She didn't want us all to suffer because of her.

That's why she offered herself to Spencer again.

I understand the reasoning.

She has no other choice.

She was thinking of Kiki, Thomas, and the rest of the troupe members.

She didn't want to force them into taking the fall.

But Olivia, why didn't you tell me?

Why did you shoulder all of this on your own?

Doesn't my presence matter at all?

How long must I...

How long must we...

How long must we be at the mercy of fate?

I just want to be with the person I love.

Are we not permitted even this small measure of happiness?

All she did was stand on stage!

What's wrong with that?

How many hearts did her voice touch from the stage of the Globe?

She resisted the status quo, held firm to her beliefs, and moved the hearts of countless people.

And this is the price she has to pay?

My breath turns ragged, and my throat feels dry.

Still, I run.

I am sick and fed up.

I don't want to lose someone who matters to me. Not again.
Will
Open this door! I'm William Shakespeare!
Will
Open this bloody door!

I bang my fist against the heavy manor door.

A low sound echoes out with each knock.

Just as my hand starts to numb from the exertion, the door slowly opens.

This time, Spencer is the one who greets me.

He stares at me, clearly not amused by my presence.
Spencer
Hola. How can I help you, chico?
Will
Is Olivia here?
Spencer
She is, por supuesto.
Spencer
This is her hogar, her home.
Will
Let me see her.
Spencer
I'm afraid not. That wouldn't be very hermoso of me, William Shakespeare.
Spencer
You should know that better than anyone.
Spencer
Your paths are separados. They will never cross again.
Spencer
That is a beautiful tragedia, indeed.
Will
Our lives aren't a play. We have the right to fight against whatever fate throws at us!
Spencer
The right you may have, but the poder is what you lack. That's just how it is.
Spencer
You don't seem to understand how precarious your standing is ahora mismo.
Spencer
Do you remember the deal we made not so long ago?
Will
...
Spencer
The guarantee in case your plan didn't go well was you, remember? That was our deal, yes?
Spencer
But you seem to be pretty much libre, free at the moment. I'm sure you know why that is.

Spencer's eyes on me are cold.

I usually find the man fairly unreadable, but today, the contempt he holds me in is plain to be seen.
Will
Olivia?
Spencer
Exacto. I knew you'd understand.
Spencer
In the end, little Olive was the one to protect you. And yet you come to incordiarme so rudely.
Spencer
Leave this place right now, William Shakespeare. Anyone but you would have gotten his cabeza removed from his neck.
Spencer
You write such beautiful historias. Your life could be so hermoso.
Spencer
But you are being incredibly unsightly right now. Not hermoso at all.
Will
...
Spencer
Olive is my prometida now. We shall leave this country in the autumn.
Spencer
You and Olive will keep those summer memorias close to your hearts as you both crumble to dust from grief.
Spencer
Isn't that a tragedia for the ages?
Spencer
It is as hermoso as the historias you write. So, write! A stage befitting your great talent has been arranged for you.
Will
What?

Spencer raises his hand, and the butler from before arrives and presents a brown sealed envelope.
Will
What is this?
Spencer
Something that you won with your own quill. It's for you to have.

I turn the envelope over.

It bears the seal of the royal family.

I break the red wax and open the letter.

Inside is an official notice.
Will
...!

I'm at a loss for words.

This, of all things? Now?

How can this be?

Truly, Queen Elizabeth knows no mercy.
Spencer
You might throw yourself into your work to continue to chase dreams of Olive, or to forget her entirely if you so choose.
Spencer
Your path lies ahead; all you must do is follow it. The Reina says so as well.
Will
...I'll have you know one thing.
Spencer
Que?
Will
Olivia and I aren't characters in a bloody play. To hell with your so-called beauty.
Will
To see her again...
Will
I would crawl through the mud on my hands and knees.
Will
I would lick grime off the shoes of the person I hate the most.
Will
Tell Olivia that's what I said.
Spencer
I didn't want to hear such a hackneyed poema come out of your mouth.

I turn my back on Spencer.

Burning anger and crippling sadness. Crushing loss and roaring belligerence.

A mix of all these feelings churns in my chest.

I clench my fists so hard that my nails dig into my palms.

Everyone's waiting for me.

All the people Olivia protected are there in the theater.

I'm still not alone.

I grind my teeth and head to the theater.

When I get there, everyone's gathered by the empty stage.
Will
Everyone.

The eyes of the whole troupe are on me.
Will
Olivia...
Will
She paid for our freedom.
Kiki
Yeah, we thought so. We'll have to fill the seats again tomorrow, huh?

I slowly shake my head.
Will
She didn't spend the troupe's money.
Will
She sold herself. To Spencer.
Kiki
Huh?
Thomas
What do you mean?
Will
She got engaged to him, like he always wanted.
Kiki
Why?!
Will
To save us.
Kiki
It can't be! But we have the revenue!
Will
She wanted us to have the money.
Will
You really think we'll be able to pull in the same revenue now that she's gone?
Kiki
...

Everyone stares at me in silence, their expressions grim.

"I look after my esclavos, that's my personal policy."

That's what Spencer said.
Will
What she did was almost certainly the only way to get us all out.

Knowing full well that she may never stand on the stage again, she locked herself in that desolate manor.

And yet I took an oath that that she'd never have to go back to Spencer on my watch...
Will
I want to take Olivia back.
Will
But right now, I don't have that power.
Will
That's why... I need your help.
Kiki
You know we'll always have your back.
Thomas
But can we actually do, Boss?

I hold up the envelope Spencer gave me.
Kiki
What's that?
Thomas
A letter?
Will
We...
Will
...have been granted a court performance.
Kiki&Thomas
What?!
Kiki
But the leader isn't here!
Will
Still...
Will
All subjects of the realm must do as Queen Elizabeth commands.
Kiki
Yeah, but...
Will
That holds true...
Will
...for everyone, no matter their station.
Kiki
Huh?
Will
Let's do it.
Will
It's not like we can put on public performances right now, so we have lots of time to prepare.
Thomas
When are we being summoned?
Will
Seven days. We have one week.
Kiki
That's not exactly lots of time!
Thomas
That's even tighter than when we had to do Hamlet!
Will
Our performance was interrupted. And this is our last...

Yes, this is the last.
Will
This is our last chance to perform on stage with our leader. Don't you want to act this to the final curtain?
Will
Aren't you pissed at all the prating knaves who tried to stop us?
Kiki
Yeah, I feel the same.
Thomas
So we're doing Hamlet?
Will
No, my new play.
Kiki&Thomas
The new one?!
Will
I completed it with Olivia last night. I'm sure it will suit Queen Elizabeth's palate.
Will
I'll prepare everyone's scripts now. Have your lines and blocking memorized within the week.
Will
I remember just how Olivia used to yell at us, and I plan to reproduce it to the letter.
Kiki
Whoa...
Thomas
So we're getting yelled at even when she's not here?
Kiki
That new work is, you know... The story about you two?

I nod.
Will
The play's title is...
Will
...Romeo and Juliet.

We have one week.

We stop our performances at the Globe and devote ourselves to rehearsals.

I am Romeo.

And Juliet will be...

...Olivia, of course.

But she's not here.

The only one who can summon her is Queen Elizabeth.

It was the Queen herself who requested our performance.

That's what we counted on.

We aroused the interest of the whole city so that our name would reach the ears of anyone who appreciates theater.

But the only chance we have to talk to the Queen is right before the performance.

Nobles gather in the court.

I don't think any of them have an inkling that we're here without our leading lady.

I'm risking it all on this gamble.

We kneel in front of the throne and wait for our audience.

And then...

A soft, sweet scent tickles my nose.

It's the scent of roses.

I sense people moving about in front of us, but I'm unable to see with my head bowed like this.

After a while, things settle down.
Queen Elizabeth
So, you are the troupe that acts in the Globe, correct?
Will
Yes.
Queen Elizabeth
Where is the one they call William Shakespeare?
Will
That would be me.
Queen Elizabeth
Rise.

I raise my face.

A woman clad in a bright red dress looks down at us, an elegant smile gracing her face.

This is...

Queen Elizabeth.
Queen Elizabeth
Your fame precedes you.
Will
...I'm honored, Your Majesty.
Queen Elizabeth
You will present a comedy today? Or perhaps a tragedy?
Will
I bring you a tragedy, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
Ah yes, the story about the Danish royal family.
Will
No.

The Queen frowns slightly.
Will
I bring for you today a new play.
Queen Elizabeth
Oh, is that so?

The corners of her mouth rise in a smile once more.
Queen Elizabeth
You have my attention. Begin at once.
Will
I cannot, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
What?

The air feels tense.

I hear a sound.

The sound of a collective gasp from everyone around me.
Will
We are missing an actor.

The expression seems to drain from the Queen's face.
Queen Elizabeth
What is the meaning of this?
Will
Our leader, Olivia Berry, is being held captive, forced into an unwanted engagement.
Will
In exchange for our freedom.
Queen Elizabeth
Olivia Berry? Is your leader a woman?
Will
Exactly so, Ma'am.

Queen Elizabeth stares right at me.

It seems like news of what happened a week ago hasn't reached her ears.
Will
It became publicly known that our leader was a woman, and we were arrested during a performance.
Queen Elizabeth
Quite the misfortune.

The Queen's tone is flat.
Queen Elizabeth
Why did you place a woman on the stage?
Queen Elizabeth
Answer poorly, and I'll see you go back to the gaol.
Will
...
Will
You will understand when you see Olivia Berry perform, Ma'am.

She narrows her eyes and stares down at me.
Will
She was born to stand on the stage.
Will
Not even the law can tear her from it. The heart of Olivia Berry will always be on the stage.
Queen Elizabeth
You mean to say there are places in this land that are beyond my authority?
Will
There are.
Will
Not even a Queen...
Will
...can command that which lies inside a person's heart.

The Queen's eyes flash.

I can feel my hair standing on end.

It takes all of my willpower to not break into a trembling mess under the Queen's gaze.
Queen Elizabeth
Mind your tongue, William Shakespeare. This is not a stage.
Queen Elizabeth
Speak out of line, and I'll have your head on a silver platter.
Will
If my head is what you want, go ahead and take it. I already live on borrowed time.
Queen Elizabeth
...

Queen Elizabeth keeps her silent gaze fixed upon me.
Will
Without Olivia Berry, we cannot show you a true love story.
Will
I defer to your judgment, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
Whatever do you mean?
Will
Abolish the gender restrictions on performers.
Will
And release Olivia Berry from her unwanted engagement forced upon her by this unjust law.

The throne room is so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

The tension is so thick that you could cut it with a knife.

The queen continues to fix me with her scrutinizing gaze.
Queen Elizabeth
You came here to say this to me?
Will
I came here to present you with a true love story. This is merely what I need to see it through.

Silence falls again.

The Queen blinks at me several times, and I notice one of her attendants glance at her from the side.
Queen Elizabeth
What you ask for...
Queen Elizabeth
...will not be conceded. Your insolence is too great. Know your place, bard.
Will
Ma'am...

My head droops.

The glossy floor of the throne room is the last thing I see before I clench my eyes tight.

So it all came to nothing.

I suppose reality doesn't work like a play.
Queen Elizabeth
Leave.
Will
...

I raise my head again.

It takes me a moment to realize that she isn't talking to me.

The gathered nobles leave.

The other troupe members are led to a separate room.

It's only me, Queen Elizabeth, and her two closest attendants left.

I can't look her in the eye.
Queen Elizabeth
You...
Will
...
Queen Elizabeth
You overestimate me, boy. I don't have that kind of power.
Will
...

A gentle, soft smile graces the Queen's lips.

She's not intimidating anymore; rather, she looks a little sad as she speaks.
Will
What?
Queen Elizabeth
It is not the law that impedes women from standing on stage, it's religion.
Queen Elizabeth
As for the engagement, the same applies. Bigamy isn't allowed. What God has put together, no man or monarch shall put asunder.
Queen Elizabeth
The Queen is not God.
Will
...

I simply stare up at her. I'm stunned.

I open my mouth in a feeble attempt to say something, but the words don't come out.
Queen Elizabeth
Is it good?
Will
Huh?

The Queen cracks a small chuckle.
Queen Elizabeth
This new play of yours.
Will
Ah.
Will
...I dare say it's a story that will be told as long as there are humans to hear it.
Queen Elizabeth
That is quite a claim. So I take it this is something a lover of theater simply must experience?

I answer her with a nod.
Will
If you don't, I am certain that you shall look back on this day and wonder what could have been.
Queen Elizabeth
I would regret it all the way to my grave?
Will
Yes.
Queen Elizabeth
Hahahahahah!
Will
...

The Queen throws her head back and lets out a throaty laugh.

Her expressions are so human.

The expressions of a feeling human being, just like the rest of us.
Queen Elizabeth
Where is this Olivia Berry you speak of?
Will
At Harold Spencer's estate, Ma'am.
Queen Elizabeth
Spencer? Ah, that debauched landowner.

The exasperation in her voice is audible.
Queen Elizabeth
I see. So this Olivia is the woman he chose to wed and take to the New World, is she?
Will
...
Queen Elizabeth
Summon Olivia Berry.

Queen Elizabeth commands one her attendants.

She bows her head and leaves the room at once.

The Queen turns back to me, quirking a roguish smile.
Queen Elizabeth
I do not have the faintest idea of what you hope to accomplish by calling this female leader of yours here.
Queen Elizabeth
Only men may stand on the stage. Do you understand?
Will
...Yes.
Queen Elizabeth
However...
Will
...
Queen Elizabeth
It has been far too long since I last saw a play. I may be too engrossed to notice the gender of the actors.
Queen Elizabeth
Besides...
Queen Elizabeth
If the audience finds themselves bored enough to care about such trifling details, you shall be decapitated for your boasts.
Queen Elizabeth
You promised me a story of true love, did you not?
Will
Yes!
Queen Elizabeth
Then begin your preparations at once.
Will
Yes!

After that, I'm taken to the waiting room with the rest of the troupe.
Kiki
Will!
Thomas
Your head's still attached?
Will
Yes, I'm fine.
Kiki
What happened?!
Will
We're performing.
Will
Olivia's on the way.

Their eyes go wide.
Kiki
How did you convince her?!
Will
I'm not sure myself, to be honest.

Kiki and Thomas cock their heads in confusion.
Kiki
So, it's good that the leader is coming, but are you sure this is okay?
Thomas
And she's playing Juliet, right? She's not even dressing as a man?
Will
I won't know until we get out there, but I think it'll be all right.
Kiki
How?!
Will
The Queen, she...

I remember Queen Elizabeth's smile.
Will
If the circumstances were different, I believe that woman might have just been a normal theater-loving girl.
Will
That's how.
Kiki
The Queen? A normal girl?
Thomas
Are you pulling our leg?
Will
It's just an impression I got.
Will
We'll start as soon as Olivia arrives. Get ready.

After a while, we hear footsteps approaching.
Olivia
What's this all about?! At least tell me why I'm here! I was released through lawful procedures! Do your own damn diligence!
Kiki
She sounds okay, at least.
Will
Heh, yeah.
Olivia
Huh?

Olivia freezes on the spot.
Will
We've been waiting for you.
Olivia
What is the meaning of this?
Olivia
What's with the getup?
Will
Can't you tell?
Will
We're about to perform.
Will
In this very court, actually.

Olivia's eyes widen.
Olivia
You were chosen?
Will
Yes. The royal invitation arrived.
Olivia
I see. Congratulations.

Olivia's tone sounds a little sad.
Thomas
Congratulations? What do you think you're here for?
Kiki
Get changed already! All of our heads will roll if we keep the Queen waiting!
Olivia
Huh? What do you mean, I'm...
Will
You wanted to perform here, didn't you?

Olivia looks up at me.

She blinks at me several times, still struggling to understand.
Olivia
...
Will
The most beautiful, brightest stage in the whole world.

A light of understanding enters her eyes.

But then...

She slowly casts her gaze down.
Olivia
But I...
Olivia
I'm a woman.

Her tone is dejected and resigned.
Will
Yes, but you forget one important thing.
Will
In this troupe, we have no rule that says women can't perform, do we?
Olivia
Haven't you had enough with one trip to the Clink?
Will
We have, and that's why...
Will
This is our final performance. We can't change the laws of this country.
Will
I can't, and neither can Queen Elizabeth.

Olivia takes a deep breath.
Olivia
You spoke to the Queen?
Will
This is our last play, Olivia. And for your farewell performance...
Will
Is there a better place than the royal court?
Olivia
What in the world? Have you all...

Olivia looks over the troupe members around us.
Olivia
...lost your bloody minds?
Will
Who cares? If we go out here, at least we'll have no regrets.
Olivia
...

Olivia still seems hesitant about it.
Will
You're playing Juliet today. Got your lines memorized?
Kiki
Here you go!

Kiki shoves the costume onto her.
Kiki
A beautiful costume to outshine the castle!
Olivia
Kiki...
Will
We practiced our heads off. You can have the leading role... if you don't think you'll drag us down.

Tears spill out of her eyes and fall onto the costume.
Olivia
...You'll pay for that one, fool.

And then she smiles.

She takes a few deep breaths and looks up.

There's no more hesitation in her eyes.

In its place is the confident gaze of a troupe leader set to perform on the greatest stage of all.
Will
Understood?

A familiar, fiery grin touches her lips.
Olivia
Let's show them what real acting looks like.
Kiki
Two households, both alike in dignity,
Kiki
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
Kiki
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Kiki
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
Kiki
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Kiki
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Kiki
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
Kiki
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
Kiki
And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Kiki
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage.
Kiki
Through this tale of true love that surmounts unending tragedy...
Kiki
...these humble players, led by Olivia Berry, shall endeavor to serve as your guides.

The first time I saw her, I wondered how such a beautiful woman could exist.

Her voice, movements, scent...

It all gripped me and never let go.

Looking back on it, that is when my fate was decided.

From that point on, there was no way back for me.

Her charm captivated me, body and soul.

When I met her, the purpose of my writing changed.

She immersed herself in my stories.

Those moments we shared were ones of pure bliss.

My quill exalted her.

The reason for my writing...

Has been to see that joyous smile.

The first day I kissed you...

The first time I felt your warmth inside me...

Our flesh became one, our warmth became one, with no boundaries between them.

Welcome you into me was the greatest happiness of my life.

Your short breaths, hot gaze, and sweet moans...

It is all carved into me now, deep and enduring.

Never did I imagine I could love so intensely.

Enough to wish that time would stop...

So that I could be with you eternally.

Cliche though those words may be, my heart yearned for such a thing.

The time to say goodbye approaches.

It's almost upon us.

But I...

But we have no regrets.

No one can strip away the love we shared.

Those days I spent with Will will always be with me.

I can revisit them as often as I want.

They'll remain in my heart until I draw my last breath.

No matter what lies ahead, or how my life ends...

I will never resent the time we spent together.

Because we were, and we loved with all of our hearts.

We carved the proof of it into the world.

Here, through the story of Romeo and Juliet.

It will become eternal.

An eternal testament to our meeting.
Queen Elizabeth
A true love story, eh?
Queen Elizabeth
Masterfully done.
Queen Elizabeth
I shall remember your names. Olivia Berry, and...
Queen Elizabeth
...William Shakespeare.

We go back to my room in silence, no need for words.

As soon as we step over the threshold, we share a long, fervent kiss.

Slowly, but steadily...

Our bodies come together in a flurry of passion.

Her taste spreads in my mouth.

Her scent penetrates my nose.

Her heat reaches my very heart.

With the sole aim of each to burn ourselves into the other...

We come together like never before.

Our clothes are scattered across the floor.
Olivia
Hah, haah...
Olivia
Please, Will. Carve yourself into me, as deep as you can.
Will
Yeah...

Her breath is ragged and hot.
Olivia
Mark me, like no one else ever will...

Olivia wraps her arms around my neck and pulls me in for another kiss.

After she finally frees me, she sits back to look at me, her eyes full of tears and a smile on her face.
Olivia
Remember it all. My body, voice, taste, scent, all of it. Don't ever forget.

Olivia gently pushes me down and straddles me.

The moon is shining bright in the sky.

Its silent light watches over us as we make passionate love one last time.

I give her everything I have.

I taste every single part of her.

I commit her entire being to memory.

And then, it seems, I've fallen asleep...

Because I dream about her.

In my dreams, we act out a story we wrote.

It's a good dream.

But the dream fades, as they do, and my hazy consciousness returns.
Will
Mm...
Olivia
You fell asleep?
Will
I think so, sorry.
Olivia
Not to worry. I fell asleep too.
Olivia
We fell asleep still connected. This is a first for me.
Will
Well, we did wear ourselves out today.
Olivia
Whatever do you mean?

Olivia gives me an impish smile.

I realize the double entendre of what I said and smile back at her.
Will
I had a dream.
Olivia
Yes.
Will
I was acting with you.
Olivia
Acting out a story we wrote?

I just gaze at her.

She smiles, nuzzling her cheek against the pillow.
Olivia
I had the same dream.
Will
...
Olivia
How strange. After writing together for so long, perhaps even our dreams are now connected.
Will
Perhaps.
Olivia
Hey, Will.
Will
Yes?
Olivia
If we can share the same dreams, it wouldn't matter how apart we are.
Olivia
I think our hearts are connected forever, and not just in a poetic sense. Don't you think so?
Will
Yes, I think the same.
Olivia
I love you, Will. I'll always be yours, and yours alone.
Will
Me too.

I stroke her hair and look at the moon outside the window. When that sinks below the horizon...

It'll be time to say goodbye.

My vision blurs with tears.
Olivia
Let's sleep, Will.
Olivia
I can't bear to just wait for the moment I have to leave you. We could share another dream together, right?

Olivia smiles at me.

Her smile is so peaceful.

She's made of sterner stuff than me, to the very end.

Despite the tears running down my face, I manage to smile back at her.
Olivia
Come here.

Olivia wraps her arms around my neck.

This time, she strokes my hair gently.
Olivia
Now, we'll stay like this until you start dreaming again.
Will
...Mhm.
Olivia
I'm going to sleep, so you'd better do the same, understood?
Will
Olivia.
Olivia
Mm?
Will
I love you. I will never love anyone the way I love you.
Will
So...
Will
Please...

...Don't go.

I manage not to say the words aloud.
Olivia
I know, Will. I know, and it's fine. I feel the same way.
Olivia
I love you too.
Will
Olivia...

There's no more to be said.

We each know what lies in the other's mind.

And yet, this is the only path we can take.

We did all we could.

But we were unable to change the world.

To change anything, really..

I cling to her in the vain hope that I never have to let go.

Our bare skin meets in a tight embrace.

I can feel her with my whole body.

I embrace her tightly, so as to mark this memory in my mind forever while I weep into her chest.
Olivia
Once the morrow comes, you'll feel better. Everything will be fine.
Olivia
We'll wake up together, and our hearts will feel renewed. We'll be able to smile again.
Will
Yes.
Olivia
The whole world will be awaiting your words from now on.
Olivia
Keep writing. Never stop.
Olivia
Okay? Understood?

I nod between pitiful sobs.
Will
Yes, I'll write... I'll write...
Will
I swore to you that I would.
Will
For you, for you only.
Will
I will keep writing.
Olivia
That's my boy.

She kisses my forehead.
Olivia
Go to sleep. You can rest now, okay? Once the morrow comes, you'll feel better.
Will
...

Olivia strokes my head and reassures me like a mother singing her child a lullaby.
Olivia
Your sorrow will melt all away as the sun streams through the window. You'll go down to the pub and peel those potatoes until night comes again.
Olivia
Rob will come, and he'll tell you to pour your dad a drink, and then you'll pour him a cup of tasteless water.
Will
Yes, yes...

I'm completely enveloped by her warmth.

Her gentle, soothing voice fills me.
Olivia
You're a little incompetent, so all you can make is bland mashed potatoes, but Rob will clean his plate while complaining all the way.
Olivia
Kiki, Thomas, and all the other troupe members will come. The seats at your counter will be full of actors to fill your life with color.
Will
Yes...

My consciousness dims as I sink into her warmth.

Is this a dream?

Surely there is no place but dreams where one can feel so at peace.

That's right.

Maybe I'm dreaming already.
Olivia
And then, standing behind that bustling bar, you will feel the seeds of new stories sprout inside of you.
Will
Yes...
Olivia
You will nurture them until they bloom. Your eyes will shine with new ideas. And neither storm nor gale will stop you from writing.
Olivia
As long as you do that...
Olivia
...your stories will always reach me.
Olivia
No matter where I am in the world, they will reach me.
Will
...

All right.

I'll keep writing stories for Olivia.

Neither storm nor gale will stop me.

And then...

I fall into a deep, pleasant slumber.

In the end...

I lied to Will.

This sadness is here to stay.

Even the sun can't burn away this love.

For as long as I live...

I will never leave behind this sadness.

I believe Will knows this too.

I sit up and watch him sleep peacefully.
Olivia
What a carefree man.

I watch him, so defenseless and open.

So innocent.

He doesn't look like a man who had the courage to try his luck against a Queen.

In his sleep, he looks like just a boy.

The love welling in me comes out as tears that spill from my eyes.

But I care not.

Like these tears, my love will never run dry.

No matter how many I shed, they'll never stop.

They trail down my cheeks and wet my lips.

Leaning in, I place small, salty kisses on his eyelids.

Through the window, I can see the moon.

How many times have I looked up at this moon since Will and I first met?

Dawn will soon come.

And so will the time for us to part.

I can't bear to see you cry anymore.

I want to stay a strong woman in your heart.

That's why...

I will sear the image of your innocent, sleeping face into my mind.
Olivia
Farewell, William Shakespeare.
Olivia
The only man I ever loved.

I plant one last, silent kiss on his lips.
Olivia
Farewell, my love...
