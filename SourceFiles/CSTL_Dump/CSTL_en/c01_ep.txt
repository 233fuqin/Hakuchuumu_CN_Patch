The new semester has begun.

As soon as I arrived, I received a thorough reprimand from my manager in the faculty room.

But since he's had the summer break to cool off, his rebuke isn't so severe.

In the end, the whole thing was resolved with an earnest apology; no need for a formal reprimand, thankfully.
Watanabe
Well, at least you got off easy.
Arishima
Sorry for worrying you.
Watanabe
You sure did, heh.
Watanabe
So, what floor?
Arishima
First. Got a group of second years.
Watanabe
Oh, I'm on the second floor. See you at lunch break.
Arishima
Sure.

Strangely enough, the second year group I have for my first lecture happens to be Rin's group.

I take a deep breath before entering the classroom.

I've gotta act normal when I see her.

I can't let anything show on my face.

This is neither fun nor thrilling.

If I'm not careful, I could ruin her life.

I steel myself and enter the classroom.
Arishima
...

But her seat is empty.

Is she late? Did she feel bad after I left?

Trying not to let how much the vacant seat affects me show, I begin the lecture.
Arishima
...

Lunch break.

I don't find Rin at her usual spot in the cafeteria either.

I wonder whether I should message her or not.

There's the chance someone might have seen us interacting on campus.

But she didn't say anything when I left home this morning.

Was she in an accident?

Did she excuse herself early?

I vaguely watch the smoke rise, my thoughts occupied completely by Rin.

And then...

The wooden door of the smoking area creaks as Watanabe slams it open in a hurry.
Watanabe
Did you hear?!
Arishima
What's the hurry, man?

He sits next to me, huffing and out of breath.
Watanabe
I heard something in the faculty room just now.
Arishima
More rumors about someone's love life?
Watanabe
Not exactly. It's about a second-year student.

Keeping my expression neutral, I turn to Watanabe.
Watanabe
I heard Hatano Rin dropped out today.
Arishima
What?
Watanabe
You know anything about that?
Arishima
...

Dropped out?

Rin?

But why?

Why didn't she tell me anything?
Watanabe
Uh?
Arishima
I'm sorry, Watanabe.
Watanabe
Huh?
Arishima
I need to go.
Watanabe
Wait, what? Why?!
Arishima
Tell the manager I'm leaving early.
Watanabe
Wha?! Wait a—

It must be bizarre to see someone my age just run off like that.

I have a bad feeling.

What's wrong?

What the hell is going on?

Is Rin safe?

Did she really drop out of the academy? Was it her who told the faculty?

I don't even bother to pick up my things. I run to the main gate, flag down a taxi, and give the driver the location of Rin's apartment.
Arishima
Rin!

I run up to the living room, but find no one.

She isn't in the bedroom, or the study, or what used to be Shuho's room.

I let my exhausted self slump onto a chair in the living room.

That's when I notice a white envelope on the desk and a sheaf of A4 copy paper.

The envelope reads "Professor."

A feeling of doom assails me.

I realize instantly that there's nothing good in that letter.

I slowly reach out and open it.

The letter is way shorter than I expected.

Professor.

If this keeps going any longer, I'll steal your whole life from you.

I don't want to ruin someone's life again. I can't bear the thought of taking everything from you.

I'm sorry.

I lied to you. Just once.

I did write my story.

I wrote about my mother.

But in the end, I never had the courage to let you read it in front of me.

So this is goodbye.

You're stronger now.

You'll be fine.

I will love you, forever and ever.

Our summer together is my most precious, irreplaceable memory. No matter what happens, I'll never forget it.

But you should forget it.

I'll remember for the both of us, so please forget about me and live on.

Always yours, Hatano Rin.

That's all she wrote.
Arishima
What the hell?

I read the letter again and again.

And then, something in the text clicks.

I don't want to ruin someone's life again. I can't bear the thought of taking everything from you.

Again? Then there must have been a first time, which means...
Arishima
The first time was... Shuho?

She still thinks that it's her fault that Shuho didn't want to get married? Does she think that her mere existence is what ruined her dad's life?

And if this is the second time, she must be talking about me.
Arishima
Ruin my life? How could she ever do that?

And...
Arishima
She wrote about her mother?

I pick up the stack of papers.

It's a manuscript written by her.

The title simply reads "Mother."

From all of this, I can only deduce one thing.

Suddenly, the first time we made love flashes across my mind.
Arishima
She's pregnant...?

If that's the case...

I need to find her as soon as possible.

She may be...

Trying to do something about it on her own.
Arishima
Why didn't you talk to me?

I spit out the words, unable to contain the rush of emotion.

Just then, my phone rings.

Thinking it might be Rin, I hurry to pick it up.

But it's a call from Watanabe.
Watanabe
Arishima? Thank goodness, you actually picked up this time.
Watanabe
Where are you, man?! You left your bag in the faculty and all. I told them you had a medical emergency.

I try to think while Watanabe talks.

No, I have no time to think.

The only thing I know for sure is that Rin has gone away somewhere.

If there are clues to be found, they must be in this house.
Arishima
Can you come meet me? I'll give you the address.

I tell him the address of the apartment complex.
Arishima
This is a giant emergency, the biggest I've ever had. Please help me.
Watanabe
Huh? I don't really get what's going on, but I just gotta go there, right? Uh, I don't think I'll remember the place from memory. Can you message me the address?
Arishima
All right.

Watanabe arrives at the entrance about thirty minutes later.

During that time I search the room but find nothing of use.

On the way from the entrance of the complex to the apartment, I explain the situation to Watanabe as quickly as I can.
Watanabe
Is this seriously Hatano Rin's home?
Arishima
Yeah.
Watanabe
And you were living here all summer? Together with her?
Arishima
I'll let you chew me out on ethics later if you want, but right now I need to find Rin. As soon as possible.
Arishima
She may be pregnant.

Watanabe freezes on the spot.
Watanabe
Oh, brother...
Arishima
I think she may be trying to abort.

Watanabe chokes out a little gasp.
Arishima
I'll respect whatever she decides to do, but I at least want to have the chance to tell her how I feel about it.
Arishima
I need to tell her that I'd like her to have the baby.

Eyes wide open, Watanabe stares right at me and sighs.
Watanabe
Haah... Okay.
Watanabe
But you seriously have to give me the whole story later. From start to finish, all the details.

I give him a quick nod in response.
Watanabe
Let me think... Oh, you were living here, right? Show me your phone.
Arishima
Huh?

I give him my phone immediately.
Watanabe
Ah, we're in luck, it's connected to the wi-fi network. You know the password?
Arishima
What?
Watanabe
Oh, did she set it up for you? Hmm...
Watanabe
Do you know where the wi-fi router is?
Arishima
Router? I don't really know?
Watanabe
Let's see...

Watanabe scans the living room wall.
Watanabe
Ah, there it is. There should be a bunch of letters and numbers written on the back of that box over there. Can you read them out for me?

Watanabe says, as he sits down and pulls a laptop out of his bag.
Watanabe
There we go. The search history's stored on the router.
Arishima
What are you doing?
Watanabe
Okay, so simply put, I can see the records of whatever sites were visited using this network.
Arishima
Okay?
Watanabe
Mmh... What's this? Wonder why she looked up so many tutorials about preparing horse mackerel.
Arishima
Probably has nothing to do with this. Can you check more recent stuff?
Watanabe
Okay. Hmm, it looks like she visited the website of a maternity clinic last week.
Arishima
Really?
Watanabe
This one.

Watanabe shows the clinic's website to me.

He opens the page about the institution.

A line on the site makes the alarms in my head go off.

To maintain confidentiality, this clinic does not require patients to register with us in order to receive treatment.
Arishima
Rin...
Arishima
Shinjuku!
Watanabe
Wait, man. You gotta calm down.

Watanabe returns to the search history screen.
Watanabe
Looks like she checked out a bunch of properties after that.
Arishima
What do you mean?
Watanabe
Shinjuku, Nikotama, Higashi-Koganei, Tokorozawa, Odawara, Atami...
Arishima
But why?
Watanabe
This is just my hunch here, but maybe she wants to have the baby?
Arishima
Huh?
Watanabe
Don't you think she may be looking for a place to live where she won't run into you?
Watanabe
She was looking at weekly apartments too.
Arishima
Damn it. It was that day?

I told her a lot of stuff after my day dealing with real estate agents.
Watanabe
And the last thing she looked up was...
Watanabe
Websites of maternity clinics in the Atami area.
Arishima
How are you doing all this?
Watanabe
I'm not doing magic over here. Anyone that knows their way around a computer can do this kind of stuff.
Watanabe
The fact you two are a little clueless about tech makes this easier.
Arishima
...
Watanabe
So, what are you gonna do?
Arishima
Can you give me the info of those maternity clinics in Atami that she was looking it?
Watanabe
Okay. There's three of them.
Arishima
Send them all. I'll wait.
Watanabe
Sure. All of them open up at 9 a.m. tomorrow. You can make it on the first train.
Arishima
No, I'm going now. Maybe I can find her nearby.
Watanabe
Geez, what even is your life right now?
Watanabe
It's like a damn soap opera.
Arishima
Thanks for all the help. You're a real lifesaver.
Watanabe
Yeah, yeah. But you better call in to the faculty yourself tomorrow. You can make up excuses on your own.
Arishima
I'll do it if I remember. You know, I think I might just quit.
Watanabe
Yeah, I figured.
Watanabe
The smoking area will be lonely without you.
Arishima
I'll call you.

I flag down a taxi and get in.
Watanabe
Be well, boss.
Arishima
Boss?
Watanabe
We'll, you're not a professor anymore, and you're going for your princess. That's a boss move, if I've ever seen one.
Arishima
Oh, stop it.

Watanabe cackles and waves me off.
Watanabe
Give Hatano my regards.
Arishima
Will do.
Arishima
Thank you for everything, really.

I close the door and the taxi's engine revs up.

I look out the window from my back seat.

All the streets I walked with Rin pass by.

Rin...

You haven't stolen my life.

You're the one who gave it to me.

Please...

Don't let me be too late.

While I'm on the train, I use my phone to make a reservation at a business hotel in Atami.

Once I arrive, I check out the addresses of the clinics that Watanabe gave me.

All of them are already closed for the day.

Even if they were open, I doubt any of them would give me Rin's information if I asked.

And it'll only make it harder to find Rin if I make myself look suspicious.

After confirming the locations, I head to the hotel.

By the time I check in, I finally feel a little more calm.

I take off my jacket and sit at the small desk in my room.

It's so cramped that the chair touches the bed when I pull it to sit.

Sitting on the hard, wooden chair, I try reading Rin's novel.

Even the woman who left me made the decision to give birth to me.

It took me too long to realize something so obvious.

Can I become a mother?

Should I become someone's mother?

It wasn't until these questions occupied my mind that I started to think about how my own mother, the woman I hated so much, might have felt.
Arishima
A mother...

Losing track of the time entirely, I keep reading her novel.

Despite the urgency of the situation, I'm unable to keep from admiring her writing.

Her words cast a spell over me.

There is something in her prose that moves the heart.

Despite myself, I smile.
Arishima
Damn... You're too much, Rin...

I feel like she has breathed life into me once again.

My worries about an abortion...

About her running off on her own and doing something she might regret later...

They're all gone now.

Because...

This novel clearly depicts Rin's feelings as she decides to become a mother.

The person who wrote this wasn't desperate.

It's made to reassure the reader and give them peace.
Arishima
You wrote this for me...

I mutter to myself in the empty room.

Rin knows my weaknesses better than anyone.

She doesn't want me to blame myself.

She wanted our summer together to remain a precious memory.

Rin's compassion toward me reminds me of a mother's love.
Arishima
You'll make a great mother, Rin...

I open the curtain and look down at the port town facing Sagami Bay.

Is Rin under one of these sparse lights dotting the streets?

After looking over Atami's cityscape, I sit down again and reread Rin's novel from the start.

The next day...

I'm keeping a close eye from afar on the entrance of the second maternity clinic that Watanabe pointed me to.

Just as the sun begins to set...

Out of the corner of my eye, I see Rin.

My heart almost jumps out of my mouth.

She's wearing the T-shirt I bought for her in Sakuragicho.

She moves like she's just another face in the crowd.

I get up hurriedly and run toward her.
Arishima
Rin!

The people around throw glances my way.

Ignoring them, I keep on calling her name.
Rin
Why...?

She's completely stunned.

By the time I'm in front of her, I'm all out of breath.
Arishima
...I'm sorry.

With my shoulders heaving and my breath ragged, I apologize.
Rin
What? Why are you apologizing?
Arishima
...It's mine, isn't it?
Rin
...

She stares at me in silence.
Rin
...... How did you find out about this place?

Despite the short distance, that little run took a whole lot out of me.

I rest my hands on my knees and regain my breath.

Rin stands still in front of me, just waiting.
Arishima
I'm sorry. I kind of let Watanabe into your house.

Her eyes widen again.
Arishima
He found your internet search history using some kind of doohickey that was on the wall.
Rin
Does that mean Professor Watanabe knows about...
Arishima
It doesn't matter. The jig is up. I'm quitting my job anyway.

Still a little shaken up, I straighten myself out and face her.

She's still frozen in place.
Arishima
I'm sorry for not noticing.
Rin
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

Rin's voice is shaky as she struggles to speak.
Rin
Didn't I tell you to forget? I wrote it all there...

She says, on the verge of breaking down into tears.
Arishima
You didn't get an abortion, did you?

She looks up at me.

Her eyes swim with unshed tears.
Arishima
It's your life, and I'll respect whatever decision you come to, but...

She looks up at me, her gaze unwavering.
Arishima
I'd like you to have the baby.
Rin
...
Rin
But...
Arishima
If you want to have the baby, then I want you to go ahead with it. I'll do whatever I can to support you.
Rin
But your life...
Rin
I thought I was gonna ruin it, that's why I...

I watch as the tears begin rolling down her face.
Rin
I thought about aborting it, but...
Rin
I just couldn't, because...
Rin
It's our baby. It's not their fault. They don't know anything yet.
Arishima
I'm glad. I'm so glad you didn't do it.

I walk up to Rin and take her into my arms.
Arishima
I'm sorry you felt forced into doing this. I should have realized. I'm sure you already know this, but I suck at being an adult.
Rin
...
Arishima
I'll move here with you. I'm quitting my job. I'll look for something new here.

Rin shakes her head.
Rin
No, you can't.
Arishima
I made love to you knowing this could happen.
Arishima
Just like you've decided to have this baby, I'll decide what to do with myself from now on.
Arishima
Besides, I really hated that stupid job.
Rin
...

I hold her closer and stroke her head.
Arishima
Let's get married. Let's meet this little baby as husband and wife.
Rin
...
Rin
Professor?
Arishima
Yes?
Rin
Do you think I can become a good mother?
Rin
I mean, I'm so young, I...
Arishima
You're not gonna be raising this child alone.
Arishima
Besides, they're the one who's going to make you into a mom as soon as they're born.
Arishima
No one else can do that.
Arishima
But you'll be a good parent. I could bet my life on that.
Rin
...
Arishima
At least, that's the impression I get after reading your debut work.
Rin
...Thanks.

She timidly wraps her arms around me and holds me back.

I can feel her warmth again, and it's never felt better.
Arishima
I'll get ready to become a dad too.
Rin
Are you sure?
Rin
Is this really what you want?

I nod in response.
Arishima
Today...
Arishima
This is the happiest day of my life.

I feel warmth spread within me, steady and strong. It's my love for Rin, growing stronger and renewed.

I made the woman I love feel so sad. I make a solemn promise in my mind never to make that same mistake again.
Arishima
I won't leave you alone ever again.
Rin
Mhm...

We hug in the middle of the street.

I won't ever forget this warmth.

I'm sure the baby will love Rin's warmth like I do.

I've no doubt in my mind.

As the usual waiter brings my coffee, the person I'm waiting for arrives.
Watanabe
Hey there.
Arishima
Long time no see.
Watanabe
Atami sure looks like a nice place. Is it nice?
Arishima
Yeah. It's pretty quiet out here.
Watanabe
How's the wife and kid? Holding up well?
Arishima
Yeah, and I've got you to thank for that. We're all doing well. We owe you a lot.
Watanabe
Yeah, you can say that again!

He laughs out loud.
Watanabe
But I didn't have such a bad time that day. It was my first time searching for someone like that. Made me feel like a true detective.
Watanabe
Can we smoke here?

Watanabe idly pulls a pack of cigarettes from his chest pocket.
Arishima
Maybe... Sorry, I stopped smoking.
Watanabe
No way, Jose!
Arishima
I figured it wouldn't be good for Rin or the baby.
Watanabe
You a dad or something?! Wait, you are!
Arishima
You're the same as ever.
Watanabe
Yeah, unlike you, my life isn't a roller coaster.

Defeated, I nod in deference.
Watanabe
The book's selling like hotcakes, eh?
Arishima
Yeah, it's downright scary.

I strongly urged Rin to try and get her novel published in some form.

Her work has a universal conflict and appeal that anyone who has a mother figure can sympathize and engage with in some way.

It's a piece of literature that can appeal to pretty much everyone.

It seems like she published it on the internet.

I'm not too well versed in that kind of thing.

But it quickly caught the attention of many people, and she was contacted by at least four publishers.

Her novel was commercialized at almost record speed.

The digital edition was released first, shortly followed by the print version. It's still growing in popularity even now.
Watanabe
Man, I'm green with envy. You think this whole genius thing is hereditary?
Arishima
No, it's all down to her own ability and effort. She's learned a lot, and she had a story to tell.
Arishima
Her story came from the unique perspective that her upbringing gave her.
Arishima
Though I suppose that's what you could call talent.
Watanabe
Are you writing together with her?

I shake my head.
Arishima
I'm her editor. I give my opinion, but I don't write.
Watanabe
Hah...
Watanabe
But I thought you were writing again too. Are you sure you wanna hang up the jacket when you just put it back on?

I shake my head.
Arishima
There's no other job for me. I've found my vocation as an editor.
Arishima
My wife's work is a given, but I also like reading other people's stuff.
Watanabe
That's you, all right.
Watanabe
Now, level with me for a minute. How much are you guys earning, for real?
Arishima
You really wanna know?
Watanabe
Damn right.
Arishima
Well, after tax, I guess we'd have about 100 million left.

Watanabe's jaw drops to the floor.
Watanabe
Uh, is this coffee, like, super expensive?! You're paying, right?!
Arishima
Of course. What do you take me for?
Watanabe
Man, maybe I should write a novel myself? Nah, forget it.
Arishima
This business can be hell if you don't take it seriously.
Watanabe
I'm fine as a part-time teacher, thank you very much.
Watanabe
Think she's almost done?
Arishima
Yeah.

This cafe is right near the maternity clinic that Rin goes to.

I always wait here during her regular checkups, and before I knew it, I was already a regular.

The coffee is good, and it's a nice place.
Watanabe
Ah, isn't that her?

I follow Watanabe's gaze and look out the window. Rin's standing there, waiting.

She's smiling and waving at us.
Watanabe
Let's go.
Arishima
Yeah.
Watanabe
Hey! Long time no see!
Rin
It's nice to see you, Professor.
Watanabe
Haah, hearing you call me 'professor' only drives home how messed up Arishima is in the head.
Rin
Ahahah! Now, isn't that the truth.
Arishima
Never gonna live this down, am I?
Rin
I don't think so. People notice the gap between us and start wondering.
Rin
That there's some kind of story there, I mean.
Arishima
No way around it.
Rin
Have you been well?
Watanabe
As fit as a fiddle. The second years are getting nervous over the upcoming exams already.
Arishima
Oh, it's that time of the year, huh? Brings back memories.
Watanabe
Yeah. Not sure what kind of memories for you, though.
Rin
Kaoru, why don't you guys stay out and chat a little longer? He came all the way from Kanagawa, right?
Watanabe
Oh, don't you worry. I'm just stopping by on my way somewhere else. I'm on a weekend trip.
Rin
Oh, I see.
Arishima
You're going to Shizuoka, right?
Watanabe
Yeah, some kind of inn where you can pick tea leaves or something.
Rin
Hmm, that sounds like a lovely time.
Arishima
Alone?
Watanabe
No way in hell! With a girl. We've been dating for a while now.
Rin
A student?
Watanabe
I'd appreciate it if you didn't lump me in with your husband. She's an office worker.
Rin
How wholesome.

Rin looks up at me and shoots me an affable leer.
Arishima
Wholesome means different things for different people.
Watanabe
Sorry for calling you guys out like this while you're expecting a baby and all that.
Rin
Don't worry, I'm in my second trimester now, so I'm getting used to it. It doesn't show that much just yet, does it?
Watanabe
Yeah, I almost forgot and all.

Watanabe turns to me.
Watanabe
No wedding ceremony, right?
Arishima
Nah. You're the only one we could invite.
Rin
Heh, right.
Watanabe
Hahah! Well, it looks like you're cut from the same cloth. What's important is that you're happy together, I'd say.

Rin smiles proudly and nods.
Watanabe
I'll get going now, boss. Get in contact if you're ever around, you hear? I'll do the same.
Arishima
Gotcha.
Rin
Have a nice weekend.
Watanabe
Will do.

Watanabe walks back to the station, waving goodbye before he slips out of view.
Rin
You have a good friend there.
Arishima
Yeah, I think he's a really good guy.
Arishima
After all, only a saint would befriend an unwholesome maniac who puts the moves on his student.
Rin
Oh, someone's mad.
Arishima
Well, it's not like I can argue with the truth.
Rin
Ahahah!

We begin to walk our way back home, side by side.
Rin
What did you two talk about?
Arishima
Just small talk. About work and stuff.
Rin
Mhm.
Arishima
He asked if I was sure I didn't want to keep writing.
Rin
...
Arishima
I bet he remembers how big of a deal it was for me when I first wrote something for you to read.
Rin
I see. I think the same, though. You should write. I wanna read your stories again.
Arishima
I'm not so sure. I don't think I'm one of the chosen ones.
Arishima
My life's full of stuff more important than writing anyway. Even I can see the writing on the wall.
Rin
More important than writing?

I nod.
Arishima
Like spending time together and supporting your writing career.
Arishima
My life has never felt more fulfilling, and I'd rather not waste any of the time I could spend with you on writing.

Rin looks up at me and positively beams.
Rin
Our baby...

She puts her hand over the little bump of her stomach.
Rin
I hope we can give them as happy a life as yours is right now.
Arishima
Yeah.
Arishima
Let's be good parents. Together.
Rin
Yes.
