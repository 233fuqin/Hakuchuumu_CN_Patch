When I stand up, Yonagi does the same.
Kaito
You're coming with me?
Yonagi
...

She shakes her head.
Yonagi
I don't want to go there.
Kaito
...I see.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Yonagi
Let's play.
Kaito
Play?

She bobs her head.
Shleep
*Cheerful chirping*
Kaito
...

I look between Yonagi and Izumo.

Both of them are staring straight at me.
Yonagi
Let's play together.

Yonagi stares into my eyes.

I turn to Izumo and think for a second.
Kaito
...Is that okay?

She nods.
Izumo
Go ahead.
Kaito
Okay.
Kaito
Yonagi.
Kaito
Let's play.

She nods and leaves her seat.

I follow her out of the dining room.
