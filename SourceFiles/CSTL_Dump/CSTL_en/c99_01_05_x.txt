The girl stares at me in silence.
Kaito
Um...
Izumo
Yes?
Kaito
Where are we?
Izumo
This is a facility called the Environmental Redevelopment Research Institute.
Kaito
That's, uh...
Izumo
The research facility's main goal is to create a safe surface environment where humans can subsist.
Kaito
I see.

I think I asked the wrong question.

I understood most of the words she said.

I understand what she's saying in general.

No one can live on the surface.

That's obvious. Anyone could tell you that.

What I want to know is...

How much memory do I retain?

For example, I know that this is a plate, and I recognize what a spoon is.

And when she mentioned what kind of facility this is, I felt a vague sense of familiarity at the term.

Academia, researchers, white coats, test tubes.

It conjures a certain image in my mind.

But I can't recall anything about myself.

I can't see myself in any of the scenes my mind conjures.
Kaito
Um, so you know who I am?

The girl nods.
Izumo
Your name is Kaito. That is all the personal information you need to know right now.
Kaito
Kaito... then. You know more about me, don't you? Like my occupation? My age?

The girl nods.
Kaito
But you can't tell me?
Izumo
This information restriction is not permanent. When the time comes, you will be informed of everything.
Izumo
But that moment isn't now.
Kaito
Am I being held here for some reason?

She shakes her head.
Izumo
You gave your consent to everything that's happening here.
Izumo
You agreed to your memory being tampered with and to the tests being run in this facility.
Kaito
Before I lost my memory, you mean?

She nods again.
Kaito
What do you mean by tests? Who's running this place?
Izumo
The activity of your cerebral cortex is being recorded during sleep. Your role is to sleep in the designated room.
Kaito
Huh?
Izumo
In short, we are recording your dreams.
Kaito
Wha...
Izumo
The facility provides for all your biological needs so that you are free to dream.
Izumo
That is your role here.
Kaito
I consented to my memory being wiped for this experiment?

She nods.
Kaito
There's no way for me to know if what you're saying is true. I have no memories at all.
Kaito
You could be feeding me lies here.
Kaito
Do you have any proof as to why I should believe you?
Izumo
No.
Kaito
...
Izumo
Even if you don't believe me, that has no bearing on the recording activities being performed.
Izumo
Whether you think I'm lying or not, you cannot leave this facility.
Izumo
No matter how hard you fight it, you will sleep eventually sleep. And I will record it.
Izumo
Once you have done that for a sufficient amount of time, your role will be over and your memories returned.
Izumo
I would point out that there is nothing that can cause you harm in this place.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito
So you're the one who's making these recordings?

She nods once more.
Kaito
Who are you? An android?

She nods again.
Izumo
You called me Izumo.
Kaito
Izumo... Are you a medical android?
Izumo
I have not been granted permission to perform medical care. I am registered as a home assistance terminal. I am capable of assisting with academic research and monitoring biosignals.
Kaito
I see...
