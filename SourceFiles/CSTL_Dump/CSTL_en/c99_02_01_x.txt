I get up.

Yonagi, who was bending over me, mimics my movement.
Kaito
How long did we sleep this time?

I mutter at no one in particular, and am reminded there are no clocks in this place.

By design, I'd assume.

I can't tell if I had a light sleep or a deep slumber.

Then, the door opens.

Izumo and Wooleep enter the room.
Izumo
Did you sleep well?
Kaito
You don't need to ask to know, do you?
Izumo
You should eat. Your blood sugar levels are low.
Kaito
Gee, thanks.

I turn to Yonagi.
Kaito
Looks like food's ready.
