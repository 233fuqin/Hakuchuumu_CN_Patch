Kaito
...

The faint outline of a familiar room superimposes itself over the one in my mind.

It's Asuma's middle side home.
Asuma
Everything after that, you already know about.
Kaito
Base will deficiency...

The illness that appeared in his memories did seems very similar to Mom and Yonagi's symptoms.
Asuma
This disease is also called the Euforia Syndrome.
Kaito
Euforia?
Yonagi
Euphoria; a very happy feeling.

Yonagi mutters at nobody in particular.
Yonagi
That's the Italian spelling, right?
Asuma
Yes. You are quite observant.
Asuma
There were countless medical incidents related to it in the year 2085. All newborn babies with the condition died shortly after birth.
Asuma
Born to this world without a single cry, and leaving it as if they had no desire to be there in the first place. They were called 'silent babies,' and it became a major social problem.
Asuma
The term base will deficiency was coined to refer to the symptoms these silent babies exhibited.

Asuma turns his gaze to his wife, lying immobile on the bed.
Asuma
But the silent babies were but a portent of what was to come.
Asuma
By 2095, young children were developing the disease as well. That was the point where humankind finally came upon the cause.

My eyes widen.

Yonagi is also looking up at Asuma, waiting for him to continue.
Asuma
It was the artificial genes. All of the silent children in 2085 were born to older people who had rejuvenated themselves with artificial genes.
Kaito
It was caused by artificial genes? But...

I follow his gaze to the bed sitting in the middle of the room.

Her skin is wrinkled and dry.

In comparison...

Asuma could even be younger than me.
Asuma
It doesn't matter if the person has taken them themselves or not. This is evolution, so to speak.
Asuma
At that time, there was no human on the surface who had not been affected by cell improvement in some way. It was a basic medical procedure.
Asuma
And that caused humans to evolve.

I...

This brings me back to a talk we had back when we still worked in the same lab.
Kaito
You taught us in school that it was artificial sweeteners that caused humans to evolve. That was all a lie?

Asuma nods.
Asuma
Elements ingested orally would take longer to evolve the species at a genetic level.
Asuma
That was a fabrication. A scenario invented in combination with lies about the strength of UV rays on the surface to encourage mob rule.
Kaito
So the middle side's UV intensity reports are faked too...
Kaito
Why all these lies? What's the need for it?
Asuma
The world population decreased drastically thanks to base will deficiency spreading like wildfire.
Asuma
But even then, there were countries with lower mortality rates.
Kaito
It differed by country? Is the disease affected by the climate or something?

He closes his eyes and shakes his head.
Asuma
Not by the climate, but by the mindset of its people.
Asuma
Countries with outdated class structures, dictatorships, communist countries that professed to be socialist...
Asuma
In such countries, the mortality rates of base will deficiency were comparatively low.
Kaito
Class structures? Communism?

That's...

It's pretty much this city.
Asuma
That was the purpose behind the design of this city.
Asuma
For humanity to survive the outbreak of base will deficiency.
Asuma
That's the true, unspoken history of this city.
Asuma
Humanity created the first underground city in the year 2150. The world population at the time was about seven hundred million.
Asuma
Over half a century of research...
Asuma
It was discovered that the desire for sunlight, air, and water acted as a prophylactic.
Asuma
That's why humanity designed a city that would both deprive itself of those three things, within a city with a strong class divide.
Asuma
The topsiders are aware of the truth, which is why they can live closest to the sun.
Asuma
If the UV rays were really a threat to humanity, you would certainly see the lowsiders being pushed to the top of the city.
Kaito
What about the ozone lens?
Asuma
Its main role is to keep the danger foremost in people's minds.
Asuma
In the early days of our living underground, there were a few fatal accidents involving people getting around surveillance and escaping to the surface.
Asuma
Some had intentionally chosen to die, while others simply couldn't abandon their desire for life on the surface.
Asuma
In order to safeguard humanity, we needed a clear reason not go to the surface.
Asuma
And so, they introduced a fake story about an artificial sweetener that was discovered around the same time artificial genes became commonplace, and the education system was reformed.
Kaito
Is that why there's no literature left on it?

He nods at me and continues.
Asuma
It took half a century for the control of information to finally change public perception.
Asuma
However, once the false information spread and became fact, the endless attempts at illegal escape stopped entirely.
Asuma
Tales of death from full-body melanoma instilled a deep fear in the people.
Asuma
Once topsiders begin to be taught the true history of the world, they are completely isolated from midsiders. They are only schooled together for the duration of elementary education.
Kaito
...

I...

All of this makes me remember Shachi.

As soon as he realized the UV rays were harmless, he climbed the cave's walls like a boy possessed and died on top of the ozone lens.

I'm the number one! Me! I'm the best!

I still remember how he screamed as he climbed towards the light.

He died slowly on top of the ozone lens while everyone watched. Was it because he'd fulfilled in one moment all the desire for nature and fame that was keeping his base will deficiency at bay?
Asuma
A social system where someone else always has it better than you...
Asuma
We cannot live without such a system in play.
Asuma
Our evolution has brought us to the point that we cannot live without constant ambition.
Kaito
But then...
Kaito
What was all that research on improving our resistance to UV rays for?
Asuma
Just one more part of this hopeless war we wage.
Asuma
Perhaps calling it a war is giving it too much credit. We lose more ground every day.
Asuma
We've been told, loud and clear, that we are no longer meant for this world.
Asuma
This is but one lone planet among the endless galaxies.
Asuma
We are merely one species on that planet meeting its evolutionary dead end.
Asuma
That's all there is to it, no more and no less.
Asuma
As humanity declines and heads towards extinction, it shouldn't matter whether a single individual lives or dies.
Asuma
As a scientist, those are my thoughts on the matter. However...

Asuma turns to the woman on the bed again.
Asuma
I still stand here, unable to give up on my wife's happiness.
Asuma
I simply can't accept the fact that the people who find a shred of happiness in this uncaring world must be the ones to die first.
Asuma
I cannot cast away the woman who found her hope in those little moments we spent together.
Kaito
You...

I clench my fists with such fury that they tremble.
Kaito
After everything you did to Yonagi?! After you trampled on everything she gave you, and cut up her brain to suit yourselves?
Kaito
You have the gall to say that?!
Asuma
Yes.

My face is twisted in anger.

He can see how furious I am, but he doesn't try to defend himself.
Asuma
I've no intention of justifying what I did. You are absolutely right.
Asuma
I wouldn't be here now if I weren't the kind of man willing to sacrifice others to accomplish his goals.
Asuma
Those are the only kinds of people who can survive in this city.
Asuma
The people so desperate to claw their way to the top that they'll tear down those above them without a second thought.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Can you say you're any different?

I grind my teeth.

I grind them so hard that I can hear it.
Asuma
If you turn off the switch at her bedside, my wife will die. Just like that.
Asuma
She cannot live by her own power. All she can do now is keep dreaming.
Asuma
She can't even breathe on her own. Flip the switch, and she'll die.
Kaito
...
Asuma
At the same time, if Yonagi's life was hooked to that switch as well, what would you do?
Kaito
What?
Asuma
For all the lip service we pay, we cannot survive without the sacrifice of others. Whether or not we see the sacrifice doesn't change what we're doing.
Asuma
You're ready to sacrifice others in order to save Yonagi too, aren't you?
Kaito
...
Asuma
That's what I did, no more, no less.

Silence falls over the room.

Only the continuous sound of the machines keeping Asuma's wife alive fill that void.
Asuma
Kaito, Yonagi.
Asuma
You... Only you have the means to deliver these people from a city of falsehood.
Kaito
And right into another life based on lies? It's not reality.
Asuma
You're right. Whether it's a happy or a sad lie seems like such a small difference in the grand scope of things.
Asuma
But when I saw my wife living happily in that false world through the monitor, I felt for the first time like my research really mattered.
Kaito
And you're asking Yonagi to sacrifice herself again to keep it up, is that it?
Asuma
...Yes.
Kaito
You can go to hell for all I care.

My voice trembles with anger.

I don't even know what to do with these emotions.

That's another thing lost to me...

This feeling boiling inside of me...

Is it anger? Sadness? Despair? Pity?

For a moment I forget to even blink, so focused am I on breathing in and out to keep my emotions from exploding out of me.
Asuma
But I won't force you to make the sacrifice alone.
Asuma
Even if the virtual space is restarted, all of Asuma Lab's members will continue their research in this city until a way to eradicate base will deficiency is found.
Asuma
With most of the people gone, we would be able to work to the fullest extent of our abilities. There would be no one left to hide from, after all.
Kaito
Is this supposed to be a negotiation?

He shakes his head.
Asuma
I won't force you anymore. The decision is up to you.
Asuma
The moment we put a scalpel to Yonagi's brain, all the researchers in Asuma Lab swore never to move to the virtual space.
Asuma
Maintaining the lives of the people in the virtual world and finding a real solution to the problem facing our species are tasks someone has to do.
Asuma
We were prepared to accept that. Not one of us believes it would serve as expiation for what we've done.
Kaito
...
Asuma
I know you are well acquainted with the progression of base will deficiency. I've told you everything I know.
Kaito
Is there...
Kaito
...no cure?
Asuma
No, sadly.

I simply stand there.

What else can I do?

Yonagi makes the first move.

She quietly gets up and takes my hand in her still mobile left one.
Yonagi
Let's go home.
Kaito
But...
Yonagi
All that's left for us to do is to give our answer.
Kaito
...

She leads me out of Asuma's house.

I'm too dumbfounded to do anything but follow her.

If I'm to believe any of what Asuma said, it would mean that the cause of her paralysis is rooted deep in humanity as a species.

Considering the position Asuma's in...

He could very well be feeding us lies to make us flee the real world out of despair.

But...

That was no made-up story.

I can feel it in my bones.

I'm the perfect example of the kind of person the city was designed to create.

I always wanted more.

Become an researcher.

Get a house in the middle side.

Finish the research I was working on.

While I was busy with that never-ending chase...

Yonagi always said she was happy enough as long we were together.

While I let my own pursuits eat into the time I could have spent with her.

And in the end...

I'm about to lose her again.

My whole life leading up to this point feels so worthless.

In the end...

I simply followed in Asuma's footsteps, from beginning to inevitable end.

Yonagi strides forward confidently, my hand still in hers.

Her confident figure inspires a feeling of deja vu in me.

Ah, that's right.

It's just like back then.

The day Shachi broke my car and I cried and she dragged me back home.

She's the same person she's always been.

I guess I haven't changed much either. I'm still that crying little boy, barely able to muster up the power to walk with her help.
Yonagi
Wanna go visit Mom?
Kaito
Huh?

She turns to me and smiles.
Yonagi
Let's go.

Before I can answer, she's already on her way.

Just like that day, she crouches over the little shrub in the center of the flowerbed.
Yonagi
Kaito.

Her voice is soft.
Yonagi
Do you think the people who were inside me were happy?
Yonagi
Even if it wasn't reality, even if it was just a world of make believe...
Yonagi
There were people who were happy with their time there, right?
Yonagi
Like that man's wife.

She's speaking very slowly. She's still facing away.
Yonagi
There are many more people just like her even now, just sleeping... waiting to be inside me again, aren't there?
Kaito
...
Yonagi
I...

Yonagi gets up and turns to face me.
Yonagi
I should go back, shouldn't I?
Yonagi
I think that's... the only meaningful thing I can do right now.
Kaito
But then you'd be...

Yonagi closes her eyes and stands there in silence.

No, there must be something we can do.

There must be, right?

Am I...

Am I going to lose her again?
Kaito
All they'd be getting is a momentary respite from the real world, completely at your expense.
Kaito
We could share what Asuma told us with everyone else and try to find a solution together.
Kaito
Isn't that what researchers are for?
Yonagi
Maybe, but...
Yonagi
I don't have that much time. I know that. You do too, right?
Kaito
...

Her words are so quiet...

And yet I hear them.

They reach my ears along with a faint breeze from the surface.

They are quiet, yet firm.

I feel them sinking in.
Yonagi
I want to end my life on my own terms.
Yonagi
Not like before. I don't want to be stripped of my personhood against my will.
Yonagi
I want to decide my fate for myself.
Yonagi
I want to decide how it ends. And I want to make that ending mean something.
Yonagi
The thought of just spending my time, day after day, slowly losing bits of myself...

She smiles at me sadly.
Yonagi
You are a kind man.
Yonagi
No matter who I become, you're always kind to me...
Yonagi
That's what makes this so hard.

The words come with a whisper and a smile.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
...

Her voice is so gentle.

The way she says my name is just like Mom used to say it.
Yonagi
Everything we did together. All the time we spent in this city...
Yonagi
Let's give it meaning.
Yonagi
I want to make the fact that I was here, that I existed... matter.
Yonagi
Help me do it.
Yonagi
We still have time.
Kaito
...

She crouches over the shrub beneath which Mom and the bird lie sleeping.
Yonagi
I wanted to be together with you. Forever and ever.
Yonagi
But because I knew that such a life could never be...
Yonagi
That small wish, seemingly within reach yet so far away... That's what kept me alive, isn't it?

Yonagi gazes at her right hand now.
Yonagi
I think the reason I can't move my fingers anymore is because that wish is fading for me.

After gazing at her palm for some time, she slowly stands up and turns back to me.
Yonagi
Kaito, let me decide.
Yonagi
I want to become their world. And I want it to be your hands that make it so.
Yonagi
I want to give my life to play that role.

Yonagi draws close to me.

She rests her head on my chest.
Yonagi
I'm sorry I couldn't be the person you were seeking.
Yonagi
I'm sorry for always being so selfish.
Yonagi
The time we spent together, with all its peace and tenderness... It's all here in my heart.
Yonagi
Even if it feels like distant memories for me, I can still feel your warmth.
Yonagi
The dreams we dreamed together—those dreams of three lives—are what's holding me together now.
Kaito
Yonagi.

I whisper her name and cradle her head to my chest.

Her head fits perfectly in my palm, as it has every other time I've held her like this.
Yonagi
Kaito, will you hold my hand?

Yonagi rests her half-immobile right hand on my left.

I take it.

I twine my fingers in hers, and hold it so tightly our palms become one.
Yonagi
Kaito...

The earthen walls around us melt away, replaced by the expanse of an endless sky.

Yellow flowers dance in the wind. They're are all around us, as far as the eye can see.
Yonagi
You'll live in my world, won't you?
Yonagi
A world where the sky spreads as far as the eye can see, where the wind can envelop you...
Yonagi
Live in it, please?
Kaito
...

We stand together in her dreamscape.

Yellow petals ride on the wind, soaring high into the sky.

I follow them with my gaze to the pure white clouds rolling lazily above.
Yonagi
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yonagi
Let's show it to them.
Yonagi
Let's show this sky to all the people who spent their lives suffering here in the underground.
Yonagi
Let's show them how it feels to have the wind in their face.
Yonagi
Even if it's a made-up world...
Yonagi
Even if it's just a momentary dream...
Kaito
...

Yonagi has made up her mind.

She's made her decision.

Even when she's been driven to the point where her voice is but a weak, faint whisper...

She's decided on her own path.

She's decided what meaning she wants to give to her life.

Now...

The only thing left for me to do is figure out how to accept it.
Kaito
Then, I...

My voice trembles.

My throat feels raw.

I can barely breathe.

But I need to do it.

I need to give her my answer.
Kaito
I'll tell everyone who will listen.
Kaito
That this sky...
Kaito
That this wind...
Kaito
That they are all the heartfelt creation of a girl. The girl who dreamed the world.
Kaito
As long as I'm there, I'll never stop telling people.
Kaito
I've decided... I'll make that my life's mission.
Yonagi
I think I'm a little too old to be a girl.
Kaito
You'll always be a girl to me.
Kaito
You have been since the day we met.
Yonagi
Mhm.

We hold each other tightly in that wide open field.
Yonagi
I want you to be the one to send me off when it's time.
Kaito
I will.
Yonagi
I'm sure that's what I... the version of me, inside my memories...
Yonagi
I'm sure that's what she would want.
Kaito
I know.
Yonagi
I'm sure she'd want to leave this world at the hands of the person she loved the most.
Kaito
I will.
Yonagi
Let's say goodbye with a smile, okay?

Slowly, she steps away from me.

My chest feels cold again without her.
Kaito
I...

I manage to choke out the words.
Kaito
I'm not ready for that yet, but...
Kaito
I'll make sure I...
Kaito
When it's time to say goodbye, I...
Kaito
I'll make sure that I can.
Kaito
I promise you.
Yonagi
Yes.
Yonagi
I'll always be watching over you.
Yonagi
You won't ever be alone.
Yonagi
So please... Smile for me, Kaito.

Will I be able to see her off with a smile when the time comes?

I can't even begin to imagine such a thing.

I fall to my knees in tears.

My hands are met with the soft soil.

The yellow flowers sway as my tears fall on them.

I clench my teeth but the tears don't stop. My eyes are shut tightly and my cheeks are swollen.

I can't keep the wails of sorrow from escaping my lips, or the tears from running down my face.

But no matter how I shout, no matter how many tears I feed into the ground below...

The sadness of losing her doesn't recede.

Just this moment.

Give me just this moment, Yonagi.

When the end comes...

I'll be strong enough to smile as I watch you go.

But let me weep for you now. Just for now.

It's been half a month since Yonagi made her decision.

We've spent those last days together at home, with our family.

Me, Yonagi, Izumo, and Wooleep.

Together as we always were.

Just letting the time pass in peace.

We communicated our intentions to both the members of Asuma Lab and the old Kaito Lab.

Both laboratories began work on an environment to keep Yonagi's body stabilized and safe. And today, they finished it.

There is one more sip of coffee left in my mug.

I'm sitting there, unwilling to take that last mouthful.
Yonagi
What kind of place do you want to live in?
Kaito
Mm?

I turn my eyes from the rippling black surface and towards Yonagi.
Yonagi
On the surface. Where do you want to live?
Kaito
Mm, let's see...
Kaito
A place by the sea, I think.
Kaito
I'd like to live in a house by the sea. With a terrace where I can sit and watch the sky and the sea stretch out forever.
Yonagi
By the sea... That sounds nice.
Kaito
I actually...

She tilts her head ever so slightly, urging me on.
Kaito
I wrote a story about us. I've been writing it this whole time.

Her eyes widen slightly.
Kaito
I'll keep telling that story in the house beside the sea.
Kaito
Until everyone in the world knows about you.
Yonagi
Thank you.
Yonagi
Well...
Yonagi
Should we get going?
Kaito
...

I turn my gaze back down to the mug.

I absently tilt it and watch the liquid pool at one side.
Kaito
Yeah.

I nod, and finish that last sip of coffee.
Kaito
Let's go.

We walk side by side through the cornfield, as we have done a thousand times before.

We are the only people around as far as the eye can see.

I look up at the city of Shinjuku.
Kaito
The reason I've lived to see this day...
Kaito
Is you.
Yonagi
Really?
Kaito
If you hadn't been with me, I'm sure I would've led a much shorter and sadder life.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Depending on how you look at it...
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
Maybe this city does have its good parts.
Kaito
You're the one that made me believe it wasn't all pointless.
Yonagi
Mhm.

We head to the institute, and find Iruma waiting for us by the entrance.
Iruma
Hey there.
Kaito
Hey.
Yonagi
Hello.

Iruma smiles at Yonagi.
Iruma
...Are you sure?
Kaito
Yeah.
Kaito
It's okay now.
Kaito
Let's go. Take us there, please.
Iruma
Mhm, all right.

Iruma takes us to the bedroom they prepared inside the lab.
Iruma
You want to be the one to do it, right?
Kaito
I'd like to.

Iruma nods in response.
Iruma
Just go through the same process we always did when gathering data from her dreamscape.
Iruma
On your signal, the program to suppress her sensory signals will start up.
Iruma
The two of you to the end, right?
Kaito
Yeah. Thanks, Iruma.
Iruma
Mhm.
Yonagi
Thank you.
Iruma
Yonagi, all you have to do is lie down and sleep.
Iruma
When Kaito leaves the room, we'll look after you.
Iruma
We've prepared the best possible environment for you down here. I guarantee that it'll be the most comfortable sleep anyone could ever ask for.
Yonagi
I'm glad to hear that.

Iruma meets Yonagi's smile in kind.

After looking at her for a moment, he turns back to me.
Kaito
Thank you, Iruma.

I see the compassion in his eyes as he nods at me.
Iruma
Okay, I'll leave you two now.
Kaito
Yeah, see you.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
Yes?
Yonagi
Can we fall asleep together one last time?
Yonagi
I want you to be the first one to step into my world.
Yonagi
I want you to talk with the memories sleeping inside of me.
Kaito
All right.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
Yes?
Yonagi
Thank you for taking care of a fake like me with so much love.
Yonagi
Thank you for loving me even when I couldn't love you back.
Yonagi
I can say truthfully that my time with you has been so happy.
Kaito
Mhm.
Yonagi
Go on and find the other me... the one that loved you with all your heart.
Yonagi
Good night.
Kaito
Good night, Yonagi. I liked being with you.
Yonagi
Me too... Thank you for showing me our memories together...

After she falls asleep, I wait for her waves to stabilize.

After her brainwaves turn to delta waves, I access her consciousness.
Kaito
...

The world inside of her is an infinite span of white.

This must be the place.

The place where I met those three back then.
Sumomo (Yonagi)
So I guess this is goodbye, huh?
Kaito
Yeah.

I turn around and see Sumomo standing there.
Sumomo (Yonagi)
Thank you for sticking with us this whole time, really.
Sumomo (Yonagi)
It was tons of fun!
Sumomo (Yonagi)
You two made the best couple ever, all the way to the end.
Kaito
Thanks, Momonouchi Sumomo.
Sumomo (Yonagi)
What's with the full name treatment?

There's a sheen of tears in Sumomo's eyes as she smiles.
Sumomo (Yonagi)
Bye bye! See you later, Kanna!
Kaito
Yeah, see you.
Olivia (Yonagi)
I...
Olivia (Yonagi)
I loved watching you work with such passion.
Olivia (Yonagi)
Don't blame yourself so much.
Olivia (Yonagi)
You had talent, and a duty to share that talent with the world.
Kaito
...I just wish I'd treasured our time together while I had it.
Olivia (Yonagi)
It's okay, dear. Because, after all...
Olivia (Yonagi)
You'll keep telling our story, won't you?

In my right hand is the story I wrote about my life with Yonagi.
Olivia (Yonagi)
Even one night of love can spawn a tale told for eternity.
Olivia (Yonagi)
I can't wait to see exactly how well you depict it. Don't you dare disappoint me now, Will.
Kaito
I would have liked to hear that before writing it, you know?

Olivia fades away, seeing me off with a cocky smile.
Rin (Yonagi)
When I met you...
Rin (Yonagi)
I was able to face myself for the first time.
Rin (Yonagi)
Because you loved me like no one else did.
Rin (Yonagi)
You made me want to love myself more, to take care of myself for the first time.
Rin (Yonagi)
I'm sorry I couldn't leave anything for you to remember me by.
Kaito
No, I...

The words about to come of my mouth sound so childish in my head that I can't help but laugh.
Kaito
I know it may sound trite, but you gave me more memories than I can count. I haven't forgotten a second of it, and I never will.
Rin (Yonagi)
...Yes, I know.

Rin looks over her shoulder, then looks up at me again.
Rin (Yonagi)
She's waiting for you. Go to her.
Kaito
All right.
Rin (Yonagi)
Farewell, Professor. You're the only one I ever loved.

As Rin fades away, white buildings begin materializing in the white world.

Their outlines are simple, as if drawn by a child.

I make my way through them, heading deeper into the white city.

In the center of it, I find a white staircase leading high into the sky.

I climb up one step at a time.

The final landing comes into view...

And at last, I see her.
Kaito
Yonagi.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Kaito
You were watching it all from here?
Yonagi
Yeah.
Yonagi
This little enclosure is the only place I can be now.
Yonagi
I'm sorry I couldn't come see you.
Yonagi
Especially after you and Izumo worked so hard to wake me up again.
Yonagi
It must have been hard on you.
Yonagi
But I just couldn't get out of here... Though I did try my hardest.

I answer with a nod.
Yonagi
But...

She turns her eyes up to me and smiles.
Yonagi
I knew you would come to see me.
Kaito
Of course I would.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Yonagi
I'm not scared anymore.
Yonagi
Thank you for coming, Kaito.
Yonagi
Thank you for loving me, despite everything.
Yonagi
I really was the happiest woman in the whole world.
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
That's why I want you to be happy too.
Yonagi
I want you to go out to that new world with all the seas, the skies, and the wind. I want you to enjoy it all to the fullest.
Yonagi
That's my only wish, okay?
Kaito
Yes.

Just like I promised...

I answer with a smile.
Yonagi
Oh dear. Didn't you say you would see me off with a smile?
Kaito
I am smiling.
Yonagi
You're crying, though.
Kaito
Yes, but I'm still smiling.
Yonagi
Oh, silly.
Kaito
You're doing the same thing.
Yonagi
Ahahah, touche.
Yonagi
Yeah, I suppose we're not that strong, are we?
Kaito
But we're smiling. Even through the tears, we can smile for the other.
Yonagi
Mhm, yeah.
Kaito
...So this is goodbye.
Yonagi
Yes.
Kaito
I'm so glad I met you. Even if things have to end like this...
Kaito
I don't have a single regret.
Yonagi
Me neither!

I smile.

Yonagi does as well.

As the tears run down our faces, we bravely smile on.
Kaito
I'll keep telling everyone about you. I bet they'll make you their goddess.
Yonagi
Goddess?! Whoa, no pressure, huh?
Kaito
I think you can handle it.
Yonagi
You think so, huh? Well, if you think so, maybe I can.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
...

We slowly approach each other.

And our lips meet, just like the first time we kissed.
Yonagi
Farewell, Kaito...

I hear her voice resonate deep in my mind.
Kaito
Mhm. Farewell, Yonagi...

Quietly, softly, the sensation of her touch melts away.

Then her breath, then her scent...

Slowly but surely, every part of her fades.

And then...

I hear the sound of waves and wind in my ears.

The briny scent of the tides fills my nose.

And strangely...

Although I've never been to the sea, I recognize it.

My eyes are still closed, but I know what I'll see.

I can visualize the ocean in all of its vastness.

And so, I slowly open my eyes.
Kaito
Aha. I see now.

This is it.

This is the same blue sea and sky that was in that story Mom always read to me. Kaito's Adventure.

That beautiful expanse of sea and the sky, merging together on the horizon...

It is the very scene now before my eyes.
Kaito
Are you watching, Yonagi?
Kaito
This is the sea we spent our lives seeking.

I find Asuma on the rooftop of the institute, looking out over Shinjuku.

I walk up to him.

He looks at me, then turns back to the city.
Asuma
Should I go?
Kaito
...No.
Kaito
I came to talk to you.
Asuma
...

I stand next to him and look out at the empty city.
Kaito
She's asleep.
Kaito
She won't dream anymore. She's the world itself now.
Asuma
I see.
Kaito
You're really gonna remain here in this city?
Asuma
Yes.
Asuma
At this rate, humanity will disappear within our generation. There's still work to be done, and someone has to do it.
Kaito
Right.
Asuma
You're going though, right?

I simply nod.
Kaito
My duty is there. So I'm going.

Now he nods.
Asuma
There are a mountain of challenges ahead of us. The dreamscape will disappear when Yonagi's life runs out.
Asuma
We merely bought ourselves some time. However...
Asuma
Hope does remain.
Kaito
...

Asuma continues as he gazes at the city.
Asuma
There were many who had developed base will deficiency before connecting to Yonagi's world.
Asuma
The progression of the disease halted while they were in the virtual space.
Kaito
Why is that? The virtual space should have given everyone a life of ease.
Kaito
One would expect it to accelerate base will deficiency.
Asuma
I have a hypothesis.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Everyone connected to the virtual world is indirectly connecting with Yonagi, and they're all sharing a consciousness through her.
Asuma
That's how the dreamscape works, right?

I nod.
Asuma
The mental support formed by each person connecting with all the others must create an equalizing effect with all those who have strong desires at an individual level.
Kaito
Mm, I see.
Asuma
Our desire to prolong our lives as individuals brought a crisis upon the whole of humanity.
Asuma
And we were saved by one person, who abandoned her individuality to become the whole world—Yonagi.
Kaito
...
Asuma
I won't waste a moment of this limited time that Yonagi has given us. I will find a real cure for base will deficiency.

With this, Asuma turns his gaze up to the white sky that shines through the ozone lens.
Kaito
...I'll just say one thing.

Asuma turns to me.
Kaito
You and all the researchers of your lab have the right to enter Yonagi's world without discrimination.
Kaito
I won't ever forgive you for what you did to her, but you don't have to stay in this world over it.
Asuma
We're not. This was our own decision. One last shred of our pride as researchers.
Kaito
If you're doing it because you've decided your duty is here, I won't object.

Asuma nods at me.
Kaito
Yonagi's world is open to everyone. That includes you, your wife, and anyone else.
Kaito
That's all I wanted to say.
Asuma
...
Kaito
I'll be in her world from now on.
Kaito
And I'll tell everyone our story.
Kaito
I'll tell them that once there was a girl who chose to become the world.
Kaito
And I'll keep saying it until everyone in the virtual world knows about her.
Asuma
I believe a shared perception in the virtual world will strengthen the mental link of those connected to it.
Asuma
Your actions could become the hope that will save humanity.
Kaito
I...
Kaito
I'll tell your story as well.
Asuma
...
Kaito
The story of a man outside that dreamlike world.
Kaito
The man who's dedicated his whole life to saving humanity from extinction.
Kaito
I'll tell the story like it is.
Asuma
I see...

As his voice trails off, a single tear escapes his tightly closed eyes.

I see it out of the corner of my eye as I look over the middle side one last time.
Kaito
I don't resent you anymore. I won't forgive you, but I don't resent you either. I'm sure she feels the same way.
Asuma
...Thank you.

His shoulders quiver as he mutters the words.

My gaze, once focused on the middle side, now moves upwards.

Bright sunlight shines through the lens.

This is a first for me.

For the first time, I realize the beauty of that round sky.
