We lay together in Hachimaru's bed, Sumomo in my arms and me stroking her hair.
Sumomo
Kanna.
Kanna
Yes?
Sumomo
I'm super happy. Just knowing I get to spend all my days together with you like this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
Kanna
Me too.
Kanna
Every moment with you is the most fun I've ever had.
Sumomo
Let's make lots of babies and stay together until we're both old and wrinkly.
Kanna
There's nowhere I would rather be.
Sumomo
But make sure you don't die before me. I'd miss you horribly.
Kanna
No way. I don't wanna live without you either.
Sumomo
Ahahah! We're both dummies in love, huh?
Kanna
That's okay by me.
Sumomo
Yeah. I like being a dummy a lot. I'm so glad I was never the brightest tool in the shed.
Sumomo
When we have kids, let's bring them up well, okay?
Kanna
Hmm... You think I'll end up like my dad?
Sumomo
Ahahah! I bet you will!
Kanna
...

All of a sudden...

Memories of Mom, indomitable as storm, and of Dad, a serious man of few words, fill my mind.

I wonder if we'll become a married couple like they were.

Now wouldn't that be something.
