While I've been talking with Izumo, I've managed to clean my plate.

Yonagi has also finished her meal.
Kaito
Thanks.

Izumo nods.

Yonagi simply stares at her empty plate.
Kaito
Mind if I go get some fresh air?
Izumo
Outside?

I nod.
Kaito
I wanna go take a look at the rooftop you took me to the other day. I can't tell what time it is in here.
Izumo
No problem. You do not need permission.
Kaito
Thanks.
Izumo
You may be able to see the sun at this time of the day.
Kaito
Okay.

The elevator door opens.
