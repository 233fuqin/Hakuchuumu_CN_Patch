Kaito
Okay, I get it.
Kaito
You do seem very familiar with my dreams.

Izumo simply answers with a nod.
Kaito
You don't seem like a con woman either.
Izumo
If the person with administrative rights over me orders it so, I can state things other than the facts available in my data banks.
Kaito
Doesn't sound like something an actual liar would admit to.
Izumo
Hm?
Kaito
Never mind.

She stares at me, the expression in her face glowing from its absence.

My attention is drawn to the spherical thing floating besides her.
Kaito
What's what?
Izumo
Wooleep.
Kaito
...
Izumo
The digital sheep, Wooleep.
Kaito
Wooleep?
Izumo
Wooleep, yes.
Kaito
Wooleep.

She gives a resolute nod.
Izumo
Wooleep is the one recording your dreams. He also assists with preventing your dreams from duplicating or becoming corrupted in some manner.
Kaito
I see.
Izumo
That's how you continue dreaming. Wooleep is constantly canceling out any information that would interfere with the dreams, so we cannot ignore the laws of physics.
Izumo
Wooleep is an assistance terminal designed to control dreams and create simulations.
Kaito
And he's a boy? You said 'he,' right?
Izumo
That was the intention of the person who named him.
Kaito
I suppose having an identity is important.

She nods thoughtfully.
Shleep
*Affirmative beeping*

Wooleep emits an electronic chirp.

Maybe that's what passes for a nod in his case.
Kaito
To be honest, I still have a mountain of questions.
Izumo
Yes?
Kaito
But I don't feel like trying to escape from here right now.
Kaito
I suppose that's the reaction my captors predicted as well.

Izumo stares at me.

This facility looks anything but flimsy.

And it seems like this whole thing has been planned out well in advance.

I have too little information to act upon.

And...
Kaito
I'm feeling really sleepy. My head feels heavy. Maybe it's some kind of side effect from having my memory wiped.
Kaito
Unless there was something in the food...

Izumo shakes her head emphatically.
Izumo
What you just ate was boiled corn. You are currently experiencing drowsiness because your blood sugar levels have risen sharply.
Kaito
I see.
Izumo
This facility has been designed as an ideal environment for the relaxation of the human body. The temperature and fragrance of this space have been chosen to ensure this.
Kaito
You mean the smell of wood?

She nods.
Izumo
It is not as expedient as sleeping pills, but it causes no negative effects to you.
Kaito
So I can sleep and wake up whenever I want?

She nods again.
Kaito
So I've been put into an environment where I can stay in bed all day, and I have a personal android looking after me...
Kaito
And all I gotta do is sleep?

She nods.

I can kind of see why I might have agreed to all this in the first place.

Not that I can remember what was on my mind at that moment.
Kaito
It just sounds pretty sketchy, if you ask me.
Kaito
Am I getting anything from this? Am I being compensated in some manner?
Izumo
All I can say is that you consented to this experiment because you judged that to be the case.
Izumo
You weren't coerced to participate in any of this.
Kaito
Okay. Now...
Kaito
Could I get a tour of this place?
Kaito
It's not like I'm going anywhere, is it?
Izumo
I will guide you.
