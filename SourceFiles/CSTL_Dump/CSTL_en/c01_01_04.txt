I finish my morning lessons without much of note happening.

I still have a slight headache.

I gargled with water a few times so my breath wouldn't stink of alcohol.

I take a book and stand in line at the cafeteria.

I don't feel like eating my usual curry, so I order soba noodles with wakame seaweed.

I take the plastic tray and head to my usual spot in the back of the cafeteria.

Rin is sitting at one of the tables on the way.

She's picking at the daily set meal of fried mackerel. Our eyes meet as I approach.

With her chopsticks raised, she bows her head in a greeting.

She's alone at her table, as usual.

Watanabe's words from yesterday echo in my mind.

She looks positively cherubic, sitting there chewing her food, and I sense nothing of the unapproachable air she has about her during class.

Should I call out to her, or just walk past her?

I walk slowly, each step taking me closer to her table.

She doesn't break eye contact for even a second.

The distance between us shrinks, our eyes set on each other.
Arishima
...Is this seat free?

I call out to her.

She nods, her jaw still moving.

I sit in front of her and place the tray and the book down on the table.

Then I pick up my chopsticks.
Rin
Oh, so you have lunch here too.
Arishima
Yeah, every day.
Rin
Me too.

The conversation ends there, and we quietly focus on our meals.

The soy broth warms my stomach up nicely.

When I put down my chopsticks for a moment, I notice Rin staring in my direction.

She's looking at the book I brought.
Rin
You really like books, don't you?
Arishima
That's fair to say, yeah.
Arishima
You could also say I have no other hobbies.
Rin
Well, it's better than having none at all, isn't it?
Arishima
Right.

I take another bite of my soba noodles.
Arishima
...You read books other than your dad's?
Rin
I do. I like mystery and fantasy books.
Arishima
That so.

That's surprising.
Rin
How about you?
Arishima
I don't read much new stuff.  Just the novels that win the Naoki and the Akutagawa prize.
Rin
Why is that?
Arishima
Been doing it since I was student, and I just kept to it.

Rin nods, lifts her bowl, and takes a sip of her miso soup.
Rin
Sometimes the other teachers come talk to me like this too.
Arishima
Hm?
Rin
Are you talking to me because you're concerned? Since I'm always alone.
Arishima
...
Rin
It's fine.
Rin
It doesn't bother me to be alone.
Arishima
...I see.
Arishima
I'm the same. I don't mind being alone. It's actually tiring to be around people.
Arishima
I'm not here because I'm worried about you.

I pinch a bit of food with my chopsticks and bring it to my mouth.

Rin stares at me quizzically.
Rin
Everyone usually encourages me to make friends. You're not quite like the other teachers, are you?
Arishima
I'm a part-time teacher. My job is to teach classical literature. No one's paying me to be a people person.
Arishima
And I spend my time alone just like you.
Arishima
You shouldn't have to force yourself to be around other people.
Arishima
At least that's how I see it.
Rin
...
Arishima
Sorry for disturbing your lunch time.
Rin
Oh, no. You're not bothering me.
Rin
I'm sorry. I just don't eat with people too often.
Rin
I didn't mean to imply I don't enjoy the company.

I just nod at her.
Arishima
How about when your dad was alive? Didn't you guys eat together?

She shakes her head immediately.
Rin
There were people that came to cook for me, but I always ate alone.
Arishima
Oh, I see.

I watch her as she eats for a while.

She's so meticulous and prim even when she eats.
Arishima
Mind if this old man gives you a piece of advice?

Rin stares at me and gives a small nod.
Arishima
I think you should be more honest about your feelings instead of bottling it all up.
Arishima
Time goes by so fast, and before you know it, you've spent years stewing in your own head.
Arishima
You're young still, and you have your whole life ahead of you. I'm a lost cause already. Don't end up like me.
Rin
What do you mean?
Arishima
I don't feel lonely when I'm alone either.
Arishima
So it's not that I dislike being alone. But I do regret never having the courage to meet people I might want to spend time with.
Arishima
And I guess it's a bit late for that now.
Rin
...
Arishima
Stuff that other people do without even thinking is hard for me.
Arishima
I just can't wrap my head around all the little things that come naturally to others.
Arishima
It's lonely, having to live that way. But I didn't realize until it was too late.
Arishima
When the little voice in your head tells you it wants to do something, maybe you should give it a listen.
Rin
I think I understand.

I raise my head to look at her.

Rin stops eating and stares at me.
Rin
What you're trying to say.

She mutters, slowly looking out over the other students in the cafeteria.

After that, her gaze settles on mine.
Rin
I feel like I know what you mean.
Arishima
You're young. You still have time. It's not too late to change yourself.
Rin
I'm not as immature as you seem to think I am. I can't change that easily.
Rin
When I think of how long I still have left to live like this...
Rin
Every day is painful for me.
Arishima
Painful?

She nods.
Rin
What would you do?
Arishima
Hm?
Rin
If you could go back to those days you can't get back, what would you do differently?
Arishima
Hmm...

I remember the anthology I found yesterday.
Arishima
I would have written more of what I wanted to write. I would have stopped trying to keep up appearances, and maybe...
Arishima
Maybe I could have written like your father did.
Arishima
Maybe my worldview would have expanded, and I could have met more diverse kinds of people.
Rin
Why can't you start doing that now?

She's looking into my eyes again.

Those innocent eyes seem to shine from within.

I simply stare back at her guileless expression, stunned.

She giggles.
Rin
If that's how you feel, I think you should just go ahead and write.

I shake my head.
Arishima
It's too late. Everything about me has become dull. I don't have any spark left.
Rin
I don't think you're quite as old and decrepit as you think.
Rin
You don't quite see yourself as an adult either, though. That's why you chose to stay in education as a teacher, and just let the time go by.
Arishima
...Maybe you're right.

She lets out a little laugh.
Rin
It's just writing. Whether you write or not, either way, the world won't change.
Rin
That was true for my father as well.
Rin
I think you could treat it more casually. Like humming a song you like.
Rin
Especially in your case.
Arishima
...

Rin looks down at her food and continues eating away.

No, Hatano Shuho definitely changed the world.

Of course, most pieces of media don't change the world. But isn't Shuho the exception to that?

I finish up the rest of my soba as the thoughts stew in my mind.

Sipping the last of the broth, I look back up at her.

I recall the picture of Hatano Shuho that I saw yesterday.

There's a certain resemblance.

She returns my stare.

And then, the first pre-class bell rings.

She still has half her meal left.
Arishima
Again, sorry for bothering you during lunch time.
Rin
No, it's fine. I'm glad we talked.
Arishima
Me too. See you at the library.

Rin nods and resumes eating the rest of her lunch.

I stand and pick up my tray.

I watch him as he goes.

...

Why did I say all that?

I'm fine?

I don't feel lonely even if I'm alone?

Aren't they exactly the kind of things a person says when they want someone to realize they're not okay?

It's not like he even asked me.

Did I want my teacher to worry about me?

Did I want him to know that I know how solitude feels?

I don't know.

I look down at my tray.

There's a bit of mackerel meat left by the tail.

The miso soup has gone cold already.

It doesn't matter.

When you eat alone, it doesn't really matter if the food is hot or cold.

I bite into the last bit of fish.

Now that I think about it, it's been a long time since I last talked with someone over a meal.

In the end, why did he decide to talk to me?

As I stare vacantly ahead while eating, I see the professor coming back with his tray.

I look up at his face as he comes closer.

Rin's face is getting closer and closer.

I mulled over whether or not I should ask her.

Writing doesn't change the world.

That's what she said, and she's probably right.

Maybe I'm just overthinking all this.
Arishima
I'm sorry, yesterday, I actually...

Rin looks puzzled.
Arishima
I found something your dad wrote back in college. I'll bring it in if you want to read it.

She's looking up at me, clearly surprised.
Arishima
If you're interested in what he was like back in his college days, I think reading that would be better than anything I can tell you.
Arishima
Don't worry, I just happened to find it, and...

After a moment, the corners of her mouth rise into a bright smile.
Rin
Thank you. I'd like that very much.

I answer with a nod.
Rin
It kind of feels like I do nothing but borrow stuff from you.
Arishima
Huh? Oh, right.

The umbrella.
Arishima
Don't worry about it. It doesn't do me any good to have it, anyway.
Rin
But you need the umbrella for the rain, right?

She giggles again.

For some reason, I seem to start fumbling around her.
Rin
I'm looking forward to reading it.
Arishima
I'll bring it to the library tomorrow.
Rin
Thanks.
Arishima
So, uh... See you.

I turn around and walk away.

Afternoon classes end at fifth period today, so I decide to go straight back home.

I wash my hands and head to my room.

I put down my bag, sit at my desk, and look at the anthology.

I check the table of contents again.

I see something that brings back a lot of memories.

My old pen name.

I almost forgot. This anthology contains my work as well as Shuho's. Side by side.

First, I open it to the page where my piece starts.

My work describes Meiji-Dori in winter, from the perspective of a single ginkgo tree standing beside the bustling city road.

As I keep reading, I remember more and more of what I was thinking at the time.

I tried to depict the drama of the various characters who pass by, and how the tree adds color to the street and life to the background of the myriad little stories that occur in everyday life. But I failed.

The professor told me that the idea wasn't a bad one, but the themes were too sprawling for the limited number of pages I had to work with.

In my youthful excess, I tried to write something bigger than everyone else.

There are also some pretentious metaphors in it that make me cringe in embarrassment.

But Watanabe was right; the passage of time really reminds me that the person who wrote this back then isn't the person I am today.

And then, there's Hatano Shuho's contribution.

He wrote a first person narrative about how he skipped a lecture one day to make a round trip from Takadanobaba to Sakuragicho.

It's a concise and short work that describes the shifting scenery in a very matter-of-fact manner.
Arishima
Sakuragicho...

I look up from the book.

There's something about the place name that makes me think.

After a moment, I remember the information about him that I found on the web.
Arishima
Somewhere in Yokohama, huh?

The location of that nighttime view on his book's cover.

Maybe Sakuragicho was already a special spot for him by this point.

I wonder if Rin knows about this.

Maybe she'll be able to glean something from what he wrote back when he was a simple college student.

I look down at his prose again.

Although he's not writing about himself or his ego in this piece, I can feel something true in it.

Reading the text he wrote, for the first time, I feel like I could reach out and touch the scenery he's trying to evoke.

In comparison, my writing was rough, stilted, and shoddy.

I feel like I could write something better now.

But that faint flicker of hope is quickly dashed.

There is no talent in me. There never was.

At this point, Shuho had already found his way of writing.

Even if it's a little unrefined at this point.

Compared to his debut novel, it feels like he's still feeling it out to find a style that fits him best.

I close the anthology.

I don't think I'll read it anymore.

I'll give it to Rin as soon as possible.

I put the book in my bag, and after a moment of hesitation, decide to do the same with the album.

The next day after classes, I find Rin is already in the library before me.

I sit in front of her.

She closes the novel she's reading and puts it on the desk.

It's another book by her dad.

I hand over the anthology and photo album to her.

She stares down at the album for a moment before slowly looking back up at me.
Rin
What is this?
Arishima
Photos from a party that was held back when your dad won the Rookie Award.

Rin stares at me blankly and blinks a few times.
Rin
Why?
Arishima
It shows your dad back when he was young. Thought you might like to have it.

She looks down again and stares at the album's cover.
Rin
Can I look inside?
Arishima
Go ahead.

She takes the album and opens it up.

She flips through the pages with a little smile on her face.

I watch her.

After a few pages, she looks back at me.

Her rose eyes have a faint glimmer to them.

Then, again, she turns that bright gaze back to the album.

She's looking at the picture of me and my wife.
Rin
A girlfriend?

I think for a second and then give her a weak nod.

She tilts her head and looks at me curiously.
Arishima
...Wife.

Her eyes widen in obvious surprise.

Then she pulls the album in closer and looks at the picture for a good while.
Rin
She's very pretty.

Then she looks up at me again.
Rin
Looks like you got lucky, huh?

Not knowing how to answer, I simply nod.
Rin
Heheh.

Ring laughs out loud.
Arishima
Your dad is in that picture too. That's why I brought it.
Rin
Oh, you're right.
Rin
What kind of person is she?
Arishima
Huh?

She looks into my eyes.
Rin
Your wife.
Arishima
Uh... She's an editor, and she's pretty good at it, I think.

The smile disappears from her face.
Rin
That's not what I meant.
Arishima
...

There's a tinge of annoyance in her tone.
Rin
I'm not asking about her profession. What's she like as a person? What drew you to her?
Arishima
...

I don't think she realizes how tough these questions are.

Her curious gaze is set squarely on me.
Arishima
She...

Rin waits patiently for me to keep going.

I search for the words, but then I remember something.
Arishima
...

The day that picture was taken...

The day we celebrated Shuho's award...

Shouko said she wanted to read my novels.

She said that to me, not to him.

That's why I...

I asked her to marry me.
Rin
Professor?
Arishima
...I don't remember.
Rin
You're a terrible liar.
Arishima
That's just how married couples are.
Arishima
We've been together for twenty-one years.
Arishima
How we got together doesn't really matter to us anymore.
Rin
You can't cover your lies with eloquence.
Arishima
...
Rin
Or with silence.
Arishima
What do you want from me?
Rin
Ahahah.

She laughs out loud again.

I even get a glimpse of her white teeth.
Rin
She's an editor, right?

I nod.
Rin
Then she must like books, same as you.
Arishima
Maybe.
Rin
Maybe?

As she repeats after me, I realize something.

I haven't seen her reading a book in years.

There aren't any books in our living room either.

Maybe she just stopped reading finished works after publishing became her job?

Or maybe we don't even share our private life anymore at this point.
Arishima
Our schedules are out of sync. Maybe she reads when I'm not around.
Arishima
Back then, we did like the same kind of books.

I point to the album.
Rin
What kind is that?
Arishima
Novels.

She stares at me, her inquisitive gaze urging me to continue.

I reel off a list of Meiji era novelists I was into at the time.

She nods deeply as I list the names for her.
Rin
I'll try reading them.

I nod back at her.

She then takes a look at the rest of the album.
Rin
This does feel kind of different.
Arishima
Different how?
Rin
It was an award party, right?

I nod in response.
Rin
I never saw him this happy about writing something in my life.
Arishima
...
Rin
It's... new to me.
Arishima
Maybe it's the difference between a pro and an amateur.

She nods.
Rin
Maybe, yes.
Rin
So he had moments like these once upon a time.

She remarks, then closes the album.
Rin
But I don't think I can take this.

Rin presents the album to me.

I stare at the album sitting between the two of us on the table.

Then I look at her.
Rin
I appreciate your concern. I'll remember how he looked in these pictures.
Rin
But I think you need this more than I do.

She keeps her eyes on mine as she reaches out for the anthology next.
Rin
This is an anthology collection, right?

I nod.
Arishima
Your dad also wrote something for it. Might be worth a lot of money.

Rin nods and begins flipping the pages.
Rin
Did you write something in here too?
Arishima
No.
Rin
Oh...

I wrote under a pseudonym.

She won't know I'm lying.
Arishima
Your dad was writing using his real name since all the way back then.

She nods and flips the pages.

I watch her read for a while then open up a book of my own and get reading myself.

She keeps reading the anthology until it's time to leave the library.

It seems like she read all of the contributions, instead of just Shuho's.
Rin
Thank you.

Rin thanks me after closing the book.

I just nod in response.
Arishima
How was it? Did you learn anything?
Rin
I was a little surprised by his writing style in this.

I nod.
Rin
But the fundamentals are the same as in his later works.
Arishima
Agreed.
Arishima
It felt like he had already found the way he wanted to write.

Rin nods and begins eyeing Shuho's text from the beginning again.
Arishima
Are you gonna be a writer too?
Rin
Huh?
Arishima
You read it all, right?

I point at the anthology.
Rin
Yes.
Arishima
Most normal hobbyist readers don't go sifting through anthologies of amateur material.
Arishima
It's mostly aspiring writers who want to measure up their abilities.
Rin
Really? I thought it was really fun to read.

I shake my head.
Arishima
The only one who made an impression and pushed past this stage was your dad.
Arishima
He was the only one who made it as a writer.
Rin
What about the person who wrote the ginkgo tree story?

I stare at her for a moment, speechless.

Noticing my silence, she raises her gaze from the collection.
Rin
This person didn't become a writer either, then.

She flips through the pages and opens my story.

I stare at the page.
Arishima
...They didn't.
Rin
I see.

She keeps reading my writing in silence.
Arishima
Why do you ask?
Rin
Huh?
Arishima
That person's one of the ordinary writers. Unlike Shuho.
Arishima
I don't think their work is any different from any of the others.
Rin
You knew this person?
Arishima
I did.
Rin
What kind of person were they?

For a moment, the possibility that she's just making fun of me crosses my mind.

But she looks genuinely curious.

There is no malice behind her words.
Arishima
They tried to become a professional writer, but I guess they stopped after graduating from college.

Rin nods and then looks back at my writing.
Rin
I'm glad.
Arishima
You... are?
Arishima
Why?

My voice comes out louder than I expected.

Rin puts a finger to her mouth.
Rin
This person is probably...

She slowly raises her face to look at me.
Rin
...a lot like my father.
Arishima
...

I can't sleep.

Her words keep echoing in my head.

I'm like Hatano Shuho?

How?

We couldn't be more diametrically opposed.

Rin...

What did she think of my writing?

Shuho was never a parent to her.

And he never left her a place to belong.

That's what she said.

The thoughts revolve around my head one after the other.

And each time, my mind becomes clearer.

She said that she was glad I didn't continue writing.

But if I resembled Shuho, wouldn't it have been better to keep writing?

What in the world did Hatano Shuho mean to Rin?

She said she didn't know.

She doesn't know anything about her father.

That's why she's reading his work.

I get up from bed.

I pace about the living room and light a cig.

I gaze up at the smoke as it rises and is sucked up by the ventilation fan.

The mystery that is Hatano Shuho keeps growing in my mind.

During my student days, I wished countless times that I could become like him.

To be appreciated like he was, earn the money he did, and write for a living.

I wished for that so many times.

In the end, all I felt for him was admiration and envy.

I can accept that now.

Even though twenty years have passed since then, my head is full of him all over again.

It's weird.

I stub out my cigarette and light another.

I stare as the red ring consuming it illuminates my face slightly.

It doesn't shine bright like a burning flame, but I can still feel its smoldering warmth.
Arishima
...Maybe I can write.

I mutter to myself.

I could chase the Shuho inside of me, and draw from that idol to make my main character.

The answer is inside of me.

At least, his character from my point of view is.

My own idealized image, given form by the side of Shuho that I saw.

It would become my own objective vision.

It would be my definition of him.

I might be able to write something out of this.

In fact, I feel an overwhelming need to put these feelings to paper.

It's been so long since I felt this way.

Writing this could save me.

And...

Rin may read it.

Maybe she could discover something from reading my writing.

Maybe she would look less desolate all the time.

The image of a lonely Rin eating by herself at a huge table in a corner of an empty mansion crosses my mind.

That loneliness she's experiencing isn't her fault.

Someone needs to help her.

And while I don't know if I can be the one to do that, I can at least try.

On that campus, where everyone is innocently enjoying college life, there's someone else like me. Someone who feels like they're sinking into the depths of the darkest ocean.

I let myself get stuck there.

And I can struggle out one more time.

My chest feels hot.

A small but true flame burns inside of me.
