With that, Izumo gets up.

I follow her lead.

Yonagi watches us then does the same.
Kaito
...You coming?
Yonagi
...

Yonagi seems to be staring in my direction, but not actually at me.
Kaito
Okay then...
Izumo
We have basically all the equipment you'll need for your daily lives. There are bathroom facilities and a simple recreation area as well.
Kaito
I see. So that's what we get in exchange for not being able to go outside?

Izumo walks at a brisk, soundless pace while the little robot floats after her.

I walk behind them, with Yonagi trailing behind me.

I can hear her bare feet slapping against the floor.
Kaito
Can't we even see the outside?
Izumo
There is a rooftop.
Kaito
I'd like to see that.
Izumo
Understood.

The elevator door opens in front of us.

The elevator door opens in front of us.

Cold air brushes against my cheeks.

I walk towards the railing and look up at the sky.

A wave of relief hits me.

This is the sky I know.

The round sky, surrounded by high walls.

The outside world is just as I... remember.

I look down.

Mid-rise dwellings and high-rise buildings spread out around the high walls.

And above that, the sky is blue and the sun dazzling.

This is the world I know.

Without my memories, I can't really judge how much of my perception is correct.

But this is the Japan I know. I know in my heart that this is Shinjuku.

I wonder if anyone has found a way to really stand under that sky.

It doesn't look like much has changed from the mental image I seem to have, so the answer is probably no.

Taking a deep breath, I notice tiny dust particles mixed into the air.

The air indoors is a lot cleaner than outside.

That too...

...is the world I know.
