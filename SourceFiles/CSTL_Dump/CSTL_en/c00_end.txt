The wind blows.

There's a small wooden cabin on the seaside.

There are many people there, embraced by the warm sea breeze.

As I finish telling our long story, I slowly open my eyes.
Kaito
And that is why we have this sea and this sky.

The people listen attentively to my words.

How many years has it been since I entered the virtual space?

Every day, I am here, telling Yonagi's story.

That is the role I picked for myself.
Kaito
We were born at a major turning point in our species' history.
Kaito
Driven into an evolutionary dead end, we abandoned our bodies, and came to this world made up of consciousness alone.
Kaito
We want for nothing in this world, for it was designed as a temporary respite for our souls.
Kaito
We were gifted the right to live here.
Kaito
But please, always remember.
Kaito
Remember that it was a girl who gave us this gift.
Kaito
Remember those who still remain outside of this world, braving harsh reality as they search for a true solution.
Kaito
And tell the story to all who will listen. To all the people who live in this beautiful world.
Kaito
Tell them that once upon a time...
Kaito
There was a girl who dreamed the world.

When I open my eyes...

I see a little seaside cabin in the distance.

It's small and cozy looking, standing there between the sea and the sky.

I can see a few people walking away from it.

With each step I take...

I remember it all.

What this place is.

Who's in that cabin.

What they are doing in there.

And who I am.

My steps feel lighter as I walk.

As I approach the cabin, the people who are leaving notice me.

For a moment they look surprised by my presence, but the surprise is quickly replaced with joy as they smile and greet me.

It's the Goddess!

I hear a little boy exclaim from behind of me, and I'm unable to keep myself from giggling at the thought.

I'm not a goddess.

I'm just a normal girl. Nothing unusual about me.

And...

I just came to see the man I love.

Walking in the opposite direction to the people leaving, I make my way to the front of the cabin.

He's looking at the book on his podium.

He could probably recite the contents of that book from memory if he wanted.

He never forgets a thing.

There are still a few people sitting on the chairs set up on the slightly worn wooden terrace. All that salt air must be rotting the wood.

One by one, they get up and leave.

All the people that notice me seem terribly surprised.

Is Kaito's description of me that striking?

Finally, the last person leaves the terrace.

The sound of the waves and the wind fill the air, bringing with them the cries of a few white birds.

The sounds envelop everything around us.

I take a step forward towards him.

Finally, I can reach out to Kaito.

I stare at the book by my hands as I wait for everyone to vacate the terrace.

After telling the story, I always stay there for a moment to reminisce about Yonagi.

When I tell her story, memories of her come rushing back to me, as intense as the moment I made them.

I keep gazing at the book until that overpowering image of her fades a little from my mind.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
...

But before my eyes is no mere image.

It's Yonagi, standing right in front of me.

Facing me with a smile I know very well.

She's looking straight at me.
Kaito
Yonagi... Is that you?

She nods, still beaming at me.
Yonagi
It sure looks that way.
Kaito
...

I approach her, tears beginning to form in my eyes.

We both walk towards the other until we meet halfway.

We clutch each other's hands in a joyful embrace.

This is the warmth I longed for for so long.
Yonagi
It's you... I can feel your hands...
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
You've been telling everyone about me this whole time, haven't you?
Kaito
That's right.
Yonagi
A boy called me a goddess just now.

I nod at her.
Kaito
Didn't I tell you?
Kaito
I said I'd make you the goddess of this world.
Kaito
And I continued telling our story until it became true.

She shakes her head, her expression amused.
Yonagi
I'm not a goddess, silly.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
I'm just a lone girl who loves you more than anyone in the world.
Yonagi
Weren't you the one who said I'll always be that girl for you?
Kaito
Yeah.

Her smile lights up her whole face.

I'm smiling right back at her.

Just like back then...

We smile at each other, just as we did on the day we parted.
Kaito
It's good to have you back.
Yonagi
I'm home, Kaito.
Yonagi
I'm home!
