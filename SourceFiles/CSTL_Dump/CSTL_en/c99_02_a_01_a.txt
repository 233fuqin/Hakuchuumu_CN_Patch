What's an adjunct professor?
Izumo
In short, it is an academic appointment wherein the person only imparts lectures.
Izumo
A person in this position is not responsible for tutoring their students like a tenured professor, nor do they have any obligation to get involved with anything outside their assigned teaching syllabus.
Izumo
Most of the people employed in this capacity are not full-time employees, so they can have side jobs as well.
Kaito
Side jobs, okay.

Arishima may still be harboring hopes of becoming a novelist someday.

Maybe that's why he chose such an arrangement for his employment.

I get the feeling that in his case, it's also a good choice in that it allows him to keep a distance from his students.
Kaito
So it's a term from the education system from long ago.
Izumo
Yes.
