Not daring to let go of one another's hands, we head inside the cabin together.

From our hands, to our cheeks, necks, and chests...

We lovingly caress one another, exploring every little part of the other with feverish abandon.
Yonagi
Kaito... Oh, Kaito... I can finally touch you...
Yonagi
Take it all off, please...
Yonagi
I want to see it all... I want to feel all of you.
Kaito
Mhm.
Yonagi
I want you to feel all of me too.

She says, slowly discarding her clothes piece by piece.

The temperature rises as we haphazardly drop our clothes to the wooden floor.
