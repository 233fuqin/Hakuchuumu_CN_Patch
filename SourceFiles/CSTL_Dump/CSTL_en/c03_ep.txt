Sumomo
The first time you let me cut your hair was in that garage, remember? Ah, the memories.

Standing in front of the mirror, I reminisce about that summer as I check out how much hair I'll be working with.
Azuki
You still cutting hair?
Sumomo
Nope. I'm in charge of hair and makeup.
Azuki
Huh, that so?
Sumomo
Yeah. I was flip-flopping between being a hairstylist or a beautician until the last minute, but I went with this because I really like helping people with their makeup.
Azuki
Heh, makes sense.
Sumomo
You're pretty used to getting your makeup done, huh? The life of a model finally agreeing with you?
Azuki
I'm on the wane already. Not like I had much time in the spotlight to begin with, being a late bloomer and all.
Sumomo
But you've still done more than some do in their whole careers! You're making history! It's amazing!
Azuki
Thanks to a certain someone.

Azuki closes her eyes.

I softly apply the eyeliner.
Azuki
Who would have thought the day he called me for a shoot would come?
Sumomo
He's been waiting for this a long time, you know? He was the first in line to ask for you as soon as your exclusivity contract with the magazine ended.
Azuki
This is just my side gig. My main business is still being a scrap hunter.
Sumomo
Why don't you buy a new car already? I bet you get paparazzi tailing you all day.
Azuki
They don't bother with me. You think they have time to chase after a minor model sporting an exclusive contract with some dumb mag?
Sumomo
You are sooo out of the loop! Do you even read the magazine you work with? It's the biggest fashion mag in the business!
Azuki
Well, it hasn't changed me one bit. I'm still living in that Hachimaru.
Sumomo
You're like the main character of some American movie. Pretty cool, girl.
Azuki
Man, I see you're as peppy as ever.

Azuki remarks, her eyes still closed.

She's really damn gorgeous.

I'm used to dealing with models in my line of work, but Azuki's still breathtaking compared to them.
Sumomo
What do you want for dinner today? You cool with a nabe pot?
Azuki
Huh? You wanna eat a fricking hot pot in summer?!
Sumomo
But it's so easy to make! We have it three times a week at home.
Azuki
I don't really care, to be honest.
Sumomo
Okay! Let's pick up some ingredients on the way back.
Azuki
You guys are living together, right?
Sumomo
Yeah.
Azuki
Well, I'm glad you two are happy together.
Sumomo
I don't know about that.
Azuki
Eh?!
Sumomo
He's really popular among the models. I can't hold a candle to them...
Sumomo
I've never experienced jealousy like this before. And he's gotten a lot cheekier since the last time you saw him.
Sumomo
I mean, what do you make of that name?
Azuki
Oh, his pen name?
Sumomo
Yeah. I'm still really mad at you for that.
Azuki
How is it my fault?!
Sumomo
You're the one who gave it to him!
Azuki
And he's the one that owned it. Nothing to do with me.
Sumomo
I guess...
Azuki
This is, what? His third book?
Azuki
The third entry to the photo book series of the rising young star, Candy Amei.
Sumomo
I'd appreciate it if you didn't say that name in front of me.
Sumomo
Azuki's coming onto the set!
Azuki
A pleasure, y'all. Looking forward to the shoot.
Staff
Good day, Ma'am!

I go up to Sumomo and Azuki as soon as I see them come in.

Neither of them have changed one bit.

They look just like they did that summer.
Kanna
Thanks for coming, Azuki.
Azuki
Don't even mention it. This old lady's honored to be asked for at all.
Kanna
That's not true. A belleza like yours cannot be withered by age.
Azuki
...
Kanna
I'll tell you about it in detail later, but I want my next book to be about my memorias.
Azuki
Memorias?

I nod.
Kanna
When I dug through my memorias, looking to express my very alma...
Kanna
One of the first things that came to mind was el verano we spent together.
Azuki
R-Right.
Kanna
I'm really glad to see you. I'll bring out your belleza, just leave it all to me!
Azuki
Okay?
Kanna
I'll go get listo. Wait for me right there, my sweet damas.
Azuki
Was that Candy? Or an alien wearing his skin?
Sumomo
His teacher's mannerisms rubbed off on him.
Azuki
I gotta have dinner with THAT today? I feel like I'm gonna lose it.
Sumomo
Don't worry. He only talks like that at work.
Sumomo
He goes back to his usual self when we're at home.
Azuki
I see. So he's playing the Candy Amei character.
Sumomo
It's like he's not even aware he's doing it.
Azuki
You were joking about him being popular among the models, right? I can't see anyone getting over how he talks.
Sumomo
They eat it right up! Apparently it's cute and funny. And his photos are always on point.
Sumomo
He's popular even when he talks like a complete clown. This industry's messed up, I tell you.
Azuki
Well, he is selling damn well. That's probably the biggest reason.

Kanna's shoot goes smoothly, as they always do.

But since he has another shoot later that day, we part ways so that Azuki and I can go shopping.
Sumomo
Kanna's shoots are pretty fun, aren't they?
Azuki
It reminded me of working with Spencer Arashiyama. That was my first time getting photographed, so I figured all photographer types were like that.
Sumomo
No way, Spencer and Candy are pretty damn unique in the industry.
Azuki
But it was fun as heck. Feels like I got enough compliments from that boy to last me two lifetimes.
Sumomo
Right?! He's like a different person, isn't he?
Azuki
So that's what you fell for, eh?
Sumomo
Can't deny that statement.
Azuki
But it's great you get to be with your partner both at work and at home. And you're both doing what you love too!
Sumomo
You're right. It's thanks to so many people. You, Kanna's daddy, and Spencer too.
Azuki
Mhm.
Sumomo
You gonna be my chauffeur today?

Azuki nods.
Sumomo
Yippee! Let's get going! It's been ages since I saw Hachimaru!
Sumomo
Come on in! It's kinda small, but make yourself at home.
Azuki
Make way! Oh, this is pretty darn cozy. Bigger than Hachimaru for sure.
Sumomo
Ahahah! True that.
Sumomo
Ah, must be Kanna.

My phone vibrates, and I pick it up.

It is Kanna.
Sumomo
He says he's on his way back.
Azuki
He finished up pretty early, huh?
Sumomo
Yeah, thankfully. When his work drags on, he tends to come back pretty late.

He said he was helping Takuma on location at one of his shoots today.

Maybe they were able to wrap up quickly because they're used to working with one another.
Sumomo
I'll go get things ready. Wait a minute.
Azuki
Want a hand?
Sumomo
Nah, I'm just chopping ingredients. I can handle that much on my own. I've been the chef around here for two years now.
Azuki
Two years, huh? Time sure flies.
Sumomo
Word.

After that summer we spent in the garage, a lot of things changed really fast.

I quit college and enrolled at a beauty school to become a cosmetologist.

The world's communication network thingies started working again, and they were so convenient that everyone started adopting the technology into their daily lives.

\\f-7;The person who got the networks back online is a famous alum of the academy Kanna attended, so when I saw the news, I was immediately tempted to get in contact with him.

But I reined myself in and focused on my studies.

At the time, I felt like I still wasn't ready to see him again.
Kanna
I'm back.
Sumomo
Welcome home!
Azuki
Yo, Candy Amei.
Kanna
It's nice to see you. Thanks for today.
Azuki
The feeling's mutual.
Kanna
Huh?
Sumomo
What is it?
Kanna
Nabe?
Sumomo
Yep!
Kanna
Again?
Sumomo
No complaining! It's easy to make!
Kanna
But it's the third time this week.
Sumomo
It's tasty and also healthy! Do you want to fatten me up or something?
Kanna
I wouldn't really mind?
Sumomo
Hah! You're just saying that so you have an excuse to switch me up for one of those young models, aren't you?!
Kanna
What? They're pretty, yeah, but my job is to take pictures of them. I wouldn't want to live with any of them.
Sumomo
Ngh! Are you saying I'm not pretty like them?!
Kanna
You're still the prettiest, cutest woman I've ever laid eyes on.
Kanna
You're my one and only. Where is this coming from?
Sumomo
Damn you...
Azuki
Did you two forget I'm here?

The three of us sit around the table.

And just like that summer, we toast with cans of shochu highball.

I became a photographer, Sumomo a cosmetologist, and Azuki a model.

Now I'm even old enough to toast them with alcohol instead of juice.

A lot has changed.

But a lot has stayed the same too.

Hanging out like this makes me feel as though we never left the garage.

And the heat from the steamy nabe hot pot is making the room feel just as stuffy as back then.
Azuki
So, what the heck happened over the last two years for you guys to end up like this?
Azuki
I'm pretty curious, to be honest.
Kanna
Huh? Sumomo didn't tell you?
Sumomo
I knew I forgot something.
Azuki
You were living together by the time we got in contact again.
Sumomo
So, uh, I was the one who got in touch with Kanna first, right?
Kanna
Yeah.
Sumomo
It was back when Kanna's first photo book came out.
Kanna
...

My first photo book was released today.

I presented a collection of photos I took while helping my mentor Spencer to some publisher, and they took care of putting them together as a book.

This was one of my goals.

The book is being sold all over the country.

I'm sure Sumomo will catch wind of it.

I placed the phone number of this office in the colophon for that reason.

My overall goal was to become an accomplished and super cool photographer.

And now that I feel like I've made it, I want to go see Sumomo.

And I would, if I knew where she lived.

Back when we parted ways there were no cell phones, so I don't know how to contact her.

And that's why...

I worked hard to get my debut book published nationwide, so Sumomo will see that I became the kind of man I promised her I would.

One night when I was out drinking with Spencer, I got so drunk that I told him all about that summer.

My mentor shed silent tears as he listened to my story.

I remember him telling me what a "preciosa summer historia" it was. He's been supporting me in getting my photos published ever since.

But he also pushed me a lot harder.

Thanks to that, I got my photo book published way faster than most people in the industry.

I've been waiting for a call all day.

I'm certain...

If she's the same Sumomo I knew back then, she'll call me.

I have faith.

The hours pass by excruciatingly slowly, but just as daylight begins to fade, the office phone rings.
Kanna
Hello. Spencer's office.
???
Kanna?

For a second, I'm rendered speechless.

It's her.
Kanna
...Sumomo.
Sumomo
Ahahah! Thank goodness! It's really you!
Kanna
You saw it?
Sumomo
Yes, I did. It's incredible! You got your own photo book!
Kanna
I thought that maybe you'd contact if me I published it.
Kanna
I... worked really hard.
Sumomo
Yes.
Kanna
I did my best to become a super cool photographer.
Sumomo
Yes.
Kanna
So...
Kanna
Can I come see you?
Sumomo
Yes!

We decide on a time and place, and I go to meet Sumomo.

We also exchanged contact information.

I've finally connected with Sumomo again.

At last.

I can tell her what I've always wanted to.

I can ask her to become my girlfriend.

I can ask her out like I've been waiting to.

In anticipation of our meeting, I looked up a pretty snazzy restaurant nearby and reserved the best table for us.

When I make it to our meeting spot, I see she's already there.

I recognize her immediately.

On the phone, she told me she'd be wearing something I'd recognize right away.

She was right about that.

She's standing there, waiting for me...

Wearing the same outfit she did during that summer.

Pulling out my digital camera, I walk up to her stealthily.
Kanna
Sumomo.
Sumomo
Huh?

As she turns around, I snap a picture of her.

Her eyes widen in surprise, a smile quirking the corners of her mouth.
Sumomo
What's with the flashy outfit? Do I even know you?
Kanna
I've been working on myself because I wanted to photograph you again. But I'm the same Kanna inside.
Sumomo
No way! You used to be way shyer!
Kanna
I guess, yeah.
Sumomo
And you're taller.
Kanna
You haven't changed at all.
Sumomo
Thank goodness! I was gonna throw myself off a cliff if you said I look old.

I shake my head.
Kanna
You're the same. The same Sumomo I fell in love with.
Sumomo
Whoa, you're coming on strong, huh?

Despite her words, her smile is bashful and she's blushing.
Kanna
Well... I made a reservation at a nearby restaurant.
Sumomo
Really?! Are you some big spender now?!
Kanna
Let's go.

The restaurant I take her to is spacious and classy.

I reserved a table right at the back for us.
Sumomo
Have you been well?
Kanna
Yeah, and you?
Sumomo
I have, yes!

I nod.
Sumomo
You're still working for the person your dad introduced you to, right?
Kanna
Sure am, but I still can't hold a candle to him. I'm learning new things from him every day.
Sumomo
Really? Is it fun?
Kanna
It's hard work, but I enjoy it a lot. How about you? What are you doing?
Sumomo
Actually... I'm a cosmetologist now.

That takes me by surprise.
Kanna
Really?!
Sumomo
Yes! After I left that summer, I went to beauty school. It was the first time I ever felt enthusiastic about studying. Now I work on film sets and stuff all over the place.
Kanna
Whoa, that's great.
Sumomo
You remember the day we went to see Halley's Comet?
Kanna
Yeah.

That was July 28th.
Sumomo
We went to the academy's rooftop together, remember? That night I fixed the hair and makeup of a girl who was crying over a boy.
Kanna
While I was taking pictures?

Sumomo nods.
Sumomo
That girl was in the same class as you.
Sumomo
Even though we never really spoke at all during my two weeks of teacher training, we chatted a lot in those fifteen minutes.
Sumomo
Lifting someone's spirits using makeup was super fun for me. So I figured this kind of thing could be the job for me.
Kanna
I never realized.
Sumomo
So I'm really glad I went through teaching training in the end.
Sumomo
I met you, and it helped me realize what I really wanted to do with my life.
Kanna
That's great.

We share a bottle of sparkling wine with our meal.

I don't really know what kind of food it is. Maybe European?
Sumomo
Do you come to this kind of place often?
Kanna
Huh? Not really.
Sumomo
I saw your photo book.
Sumomo
There's lots of pictures of pretty women in it.

I nod.

In the end, I followed in the footsteps of my mentor to focus mainly on portrait photography.

My debut photo book focuses on people too.
Sumomo
So I wondered if you come to this kind of place a lot.
Kanna
With models, you mean?
Sumomo
Yeah.

I snort.
Sumomo
What was that for?!
Kanna
It's just funny that you'd be jealous over something like that.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
I don't come to fancy places like this. My mentor sometimes invites me, but I've never been out for dinner with a model.
Kanna
I was so focused on improving my work that I never had time.
Sumomo
I see.
Kanna
I reserved a table here because it's a special day.
Kanna
I don't even know what kind of food this is.
Sumomo
Ahahah! I'm glad to hear that. You really are still the same Kanna.
Kanna
Of course I am.
Sumomo
So today's a special day?
Kanna
...

I nod without saying anything.
Sumomo
Why?

She quirks a mischievous smile.

The wine has brought a rosy bloom to her cheeks.
Kanna
Because today is the day...
Kanna
I can finally tell the person I love how I feel.
Sumomo
...
Kanna
Sumomo.
Sumomo
Yes?
Kanna
I still love you.
Kanna
This whole time we've been apart, you've always been the only one on my mind.
Sumomo
Mm.
Kanna
I'm not a kid anymore. I think I have what it takes now.

Sumomo smiles softly.
Kanna
So...
Kanna
I want you to be my girlfriend, and...
Kanna
...maybe even my wife, someday.
Kanna
I want to go steady.

I look straight into her eyes.

Sumomo...

She looks back at me, her smile lighting up her whole face.
Sumomo
Yes.

We come out of the restaurant holding hands.

The warmth I've been dreaming about for so long is finally here in the palm of my hand.
Sumomo
Your place...
Kanna
Hm?
Sumomo
Is it close?

I nod.
Kanna
Yours?
Sumomo
It's not far, but...
Sumomo
I don't wanna go home tonight.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
Can I stay over at your place?

Without a moment's hesitation, I nod.
Sumomo
And then, we came here to this apartment.
Sumomo
That was our first time, huh?
Azuki
Yeah, I didn't need to hear that! I could figure that out for myself! You obviously didn't come here to play video games!
Sumomo
Ahahah!
Kanna
I still remember it like it was yesterday. Can't believe it's been two years since then.
Azuki
So next you're gonna be tying the knot and living happily ever after?

Beaming, Sumomo nods.

I nod as well.
Azuki
Man, it's still kinda hard for me to wrap my head around.
Azuki
I mean, back then you were a student, and she was your teacher, right?
Sumomo
I was in training! I was still a student. You're the one who was way older than both of us!
Azuki
Oh, cut the crap!
Kanna
I never expected things to turn out like this either.
Kanna
Neither did Sumomo, did you?
Sumomo
I guess not. Back then, I was really worried about you being younger.
Sumomo
Now it's no big deal, but back when you were a student it was kind of iffy.
Azuki
Who cares?! Age is just a number, isn't it?!
Sumomo
Ahahah! You're sooo desperate.
Azuki
Am not!

The good times keep rolling, and so does time itself.

By now, the only thing left in the bottom of the pot is hardened grease.
Sumomo
Are you staying the night, Azuki?
Azuki
Eh? Is that late already?
Sumomo
Wait, you're driving, right? You sure you should be drinking?
Azuki
It's all good.

She takes her car keys out of her pocket.

I recognize them right away.

They're for Hachimaru.
Azuki
I wanna give this back.

Her voice is quiet.

I stare blankly at her for a moment.
Kanna
Uh, why? It's yours.
Azuki
You gave the Hachimaru to me because you thought your ma would be happier if I were driving it around, right?
Azuki
But the situation's different now. When you and Peach make some babies, you gotta take the little buggers camping!
Azuki
I bet that'd make your ma even happier.

Azuki flashes me a confident, reassuring grin.
Kanna
...
Sumomo
But weren't you living in the car?
Azuki
I've saved up more than enough money. It's about time I look for a place to settle down.
Azuki
I'm not getting any younger.
Sumomo
You still got plenty left in you! You're gorgeous! Those young models got nothing on you.
Azuki
It's fine. I've never been out to compete with anyone.
Kanna
But...
Azuki
I've kept it well maintained. It might look the same, but that car's sturdier than it's ever been. Besides...
Azuki
We have phones now. If anything happens, give your personal scrap hunter a call and she'll be there in a flash to fix you right up.
Kanna
...
Azuki
It's my wedding gift. Take it, Candy.
Kanna
...Thanks.
Sumomo
Yeah, thank you. You're the coolest lady in the whole wide world!
Azuki
Heh, that's a given.

After accompanying Azuki to the nearest train station, we go to the parking lot where Hachimaru's parked and get in.
Sumomo
Whoa! What a blast from the past!
Kanna
It hasn't changed at all.
Sumomo
Hey, sooo...
Kanna
Yes?

She smiles mischievously and points towards the camp bed.

This is where we slept together on the last day of that summer.

I nod, and she lays down on the narrow bed, beckoning to me.

We cuddle up together, just as we did that day.
Sumomo
Kanna.
Kanna
Yes?
Sumomo
I'm super happy. Just knowing I get to spend all my days together with you like this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Kanna
Me too.
Kanna
Every moment with you is the most fun I've ever had.
Sumomo
Let's make lots of babies and stay together until we're both old and wrinkly.
Kanna
There's nowhere I'd rather be.
Sumomo
But make sure you don't die before me. I'd miss you horribly.
Kanna
No way. I don't wanna live without you either.
Sumomo
Ahahah! We're both dummies in love, huh?
Kanna
That's okay by me.
Sumomo
Yeah. I like being a dummy a lot. I'm so glad I was never the brightest tool in the shed.
Sumomo
When we have kids, let's bring them up well, okay?
Kanna
Hmm... You think I'll end up like my dad?
Sumomo
Ahahah! I bet you will!
Kanna
...

All of a sudden...

Memories of Mom, indomitable as a storm, and of Dad, a serious man of few words, fill my mind.

I wonder if we'll become a married couple like they were.

Now wouldn't that be something.
