Kaito
A man named Christopher Marlowe appeared in my dream.
Izumo
A playwright who was active in England during the sixteenth century.

I glance at Yonagi.

She's staring absently at nothing like usual.

I then turn back to Izumo.
Kaito
Right.
Izumo
William Shakespeare went on to become widely regarded as the greatest writer who ever lived, but at the time of his debut, Christopher Marlowe was a popular household name.
Kaito
Yeah, he seemed pretty popular.
Izumo
His most famous works are 'The Jew of Malta' and 'Tamburlaine the Great.' He was a worthy contemporary and rival for Shakespeare.
Izumo
If Shakespeare never started writing, perhaps he would have been the most well known writer of the Elizabethan era.
Kaito
He was that good?
Izumo
Even taking into account the misfortune of Marlowe's untimely death in the middle of his career, Shakespeare's fame as a writer simply came to eclipse his.
Kaito
But why? Wasn't he popular?
Izumo
It is said that the play that brought him fame was Tamburlaine the Great.
Izumo
As for the momentum he gained after debuting that play... perhaps he simply lacked the modesty to make use of it.
Kaito
What do you mean?
Izumo
In the twentieth century, critics began to argue that his subsequent works were mostly written by other hands.
Kaito
Like the Jew of Malta?

Izumo nods.
Izumo
Even if the first two acts were written by Marlowe, critics speculate that the subsequent three acts may have been written by other people.
Kaito
That's more than half the play.
Izumo
If it had Marlowe's name on it, it would sell.
Izumo
At the time, Marlowe may have been dazzled by the allure of reaping easy prestige, rather than than going through the hard work of meticulously honing his craft.
Izumo
There are also theories that he was in fact acting as spy in the service of Queen Elizabeth's service.
Kaito
A spy? What for?
Izumo
Mainly...
Izumo
As a tipper reporting on the current religious target at the time. The Catholic faith.
Kaito
...

Catholics, huh?

Right, Will's house...

It's a secret place of congregation for Catholics.
Kaito
So he's a pretty clear cut enemy, then.
Izumo
At any rate, verifiably accurate data from Shakespeare's time is scarce, and there are many different interpretations and theories. I think you should be aware of that.
Kaito
Yeah, thanks. That gave me a lot to think about.
Izumo
Is that so?
