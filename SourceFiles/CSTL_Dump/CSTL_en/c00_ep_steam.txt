When I open my eyes...

I see a little seaside cabin in the distance.

It's small and cozy looking, standing there between the sea and the sky.

I can see a few people walking away from it.

With each step I take...

I remember it all.

What this place is.

Who's in that cabin.

What they are doing in there.

And who I am.

My steps feel lighter as I walk.

As I approach the cabin, the people who are leaving notice me.

For a moment they look surprised by my presence, but the surprise is quickly replaced with joy as they smile and greet me.

It's the Goddess!

I hear a little boy exclaim from behind of me, and I'm unable to keep myself from giggling at the thought.

I'm not a goddess.

I'm just a normal girl. Nothing unusual about me.

And...

I just came to see the man I love.

Walking in the opposite direction to the people leaving, I make my way to the front of the cabin.

He's looking at the book on his podium.

He could probably recite the contents of that book from memory if he wanted.

He never forgets a thing.

There are still a few people sitting on the chairs set up on the slightly worn wooden terrace. All that salt air must be rotting the wood.

One by one, they get up and leave.

All the people that notice me seem terribly surprised.

Is Kaito's description of me that striking?

Finally, the last person leaves the terrace.

The sound of the waves and the wind fill the air, bringing with them the cries of a few white birds.

The sounds envelop everything around us.

I take a step forward towards him.

Finally, I can reach out to Kaito.

I stare at the book by my hands as I wait for everyone to vacate the terrace.

After telling the story, I always stay there for a moment to reminisce about Yonagi.

When I tell her story, memories of her come rushing back to me, as intense as the moment I made them.

I keep gazing at the book until that overpowering image of her fades a little from my mind.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
...

But before my eyes is no mere image.

It's Yonagi, standing right in front of me.

Facing me with a smile I know very well.

She's looking straight at me.
Kaito
Yonagi... Is that you?

She nods, still beaming at me.
Yonagi
It sure looks that way.
Kaito
...

I approach her, tears beginning to form in my eyes.

We both walk towards the other until we meet halfway.

We clutch each other's hands in a joyful embrace.

This is the warmth I longed for for so long.
Yonagi
It's you... I can feel your hands...
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
You've been telling everyone about me this whole time, haven't you?
Kaito
That's right.
Yonagi
A boy called me a goddess just now.

I nod at her.
Kaito
Didn't I tell you?
Kaito
I said I'd make you the goddess of this world.
Kaito
And I continued telling our story until it became true.

She shakes her head, her expression amused.
Yonagi
I'm not a goddess, silly.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
I'm just a lone girl who loves you more than anyone in the world.
Yonagi
Weren't you the one who said I'll always be that girl for you?
Kaito
Yeah.

Her smile lights up her whole face.

I'm smiling right back at her.

Just like back then...

We smile at each other, just as we did on the day we parted.
Kaito
It's good to have you back.
Yonagi
I'm home, Kaito.
Yonagi
I'm home!

We leave the cabin one morning and come out onto a mountain trail by the sea.

Yonagi and I walk down the gentle slopes with the wind at our backs.

Nothing like a little bit of hiking as you listen to the sound of the waves crashing in the distance.
Yonagi
I was watching all this time. Every time you told our story.
Kaito
It was my duty for a reason. Those were fine days. Remembering our story every single day meant I never felt lonely.

She turns to face me and and gives a sweet smile.
Yonagi
I think you were a little too literal, though. Now everyone in the world knows every single thing about us. Like, every detail!
Kaito
And that's why you're here right now.
Yonagi
Uh...

She flushes and hangs her head.

I can't help but smile at her bashfulness.

Her cheeks remain rosy as her smile softens somewhat.
Yonagi
It's incredible, really. Now all the people of Shinjuku live here, right?

I nod in response.
Kaito
Not just Shinjuku. All the people living underground in other countries too.
Yonagi
Do you think they're all happy?
Kaito
Yeah. Every day since I entered this world, I've seen the faces of the people who came to listen to our story. Everyone seemed happy. We all have our worries, but they looked content with life.
Yonagi
That's good to hear.

We walk along the trail toward the seashore.

The sound of our steps is accompanied by the waves.

We're holding hands as we go.

I can feel her warmth against my palm.

I hold her hand tightly, and she responds with a squeeze of her own.
Yonagi
Kaito?

Yonagi casts her gaze down at the road.

I turn my head to her as we keep walking.

After a moment of silence, she looks up at me again and speaks.
Yonagi
How's Professor Asuma?

I face the road ahead and ponder for a moment.
Kaito
The researchers of Asuma Lab are still working in Shinjuku.
Kaito
Izumo keeps me updated on their progress. There are some people who registered as gene donors after hearing my story.
Kaito
The genetic sample pool collected at Asuma lab must be the most complete since humans began living underground.

Yonagi nods.
Kaito
There are some people with base will deficiency whose symptoms have stopped progressing.
Kaito
Their lab has all the data on what kind of life the donors had, how they felt, and what kind of changes occurred in their bodies.
Kaito
They're not hurting for samples. I know he won't give up either. He'll find a cure.

Yonagi smiles again upon hearing this.

After studying my face for a moment, she nods.
Kaito
We're just going our own ways and doing what we have to do. We don't talk, and I think it's better that way. It's fine.
Yonagi
Mhm...

She nods, giving my hand a reassuring squeeze.

We keep walking, taking in the sound of the waves and the briny scent of the tide.
Yonagi
This reminds me of the times we walked through the low side.

She says, turning her gaze up to me.

I let out a small chuckle and nod.

The beach comes into view before long.

The stony mountain path ends and we come out onto the sandy beach.

As we get there, we see a middle-aged couple up ahead who are taking a walk together just like us.

For some reason, the woman catches my attention.

She notices my gaze, smiles, and gives us a small nod by way of greeting.

Her face has some familiar vestiges. I remember it... from Asuma's memories.

I don't recognize the man beside her.

I stop for a moment and watch them walk away.
Yonagi
Kaito?

Yonagi raises an eyebrow and cocks her head at me.
Yonagi
Aren't we going?
Kaito
Ah, yes.

We do what we need to do.

That means carrying one's burden as well.

We slowly approach the shore.
Yonagi
Whoa...

Once we make it close to the water, Yonagi slips out of her sandals and walks barefoot on the warm sand.

The pure white sand glimmers under the sunlight.

I catch sight of a white bird flying overhead.

It's a seagull.

It's a lot bigger than the bird that we found in the middle side all those years ago.

A few people are interspersed here and there across the beach.

They're spending their time in peace, be it enjoying the company of others, or laying on the sand and gazing at the clouds above.

Yonagi walks by the water's edge, the gentle waves dancing over her bare feet.

Yonagi walks by the shore, dipping her feet in the water.

The foam left in the wake of the waves glistens beneath the golden sunshine.
Yonagi
The water feels so good.

Yonagi murmurs to herself.

I watch her from a few paces back, away from the water.

I watch the gentle breeze play with her hair.

Her fair skin and hair are as white as the pearly sands.

After a moment, she comes dashing over to me.
Yonagi
Look at all this water!

She exclaims, extending her arms.

I smile, which Yonagi returns in kind.
Yonagi
And all this sky! It's so beautiful!
Kaito
Yeah, they both are.

She nods again, her eyes sparkling with expectation.

Then she looks up at the sky.

Yonagi closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and then breathes out.

The cry of a seagull rings far in the distance.
Yonagi
I'm so glad that everyone's world is so beautiful.

She says as she sits down beside me.

We're surrounded by the sound of the waves.
Kaito
Everyone must have been thinking of you.
Yonagi
Mm?

I take Yonagi's hand in mine.
Kaito
That's why we can touch each other again.

Yonagi looks down at our interlocked hands.

Then she looks back up at me and smiles.
Yonagi
Everyone's so kind. This is such a kind world.
Kaito
Yeah, you're right.
Kaito
I'm sure there'll be many people who'll want to catch a glimpse of you from now on.
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
You're a goddess, remember?

She laughs and shakes her head.
Yonagi
Right. It's just a little... No, actually, it sounds like it could be fun.

She says as she rests her head on my chest.

We stay like that for a while, watching the placid waves come and go.
Kaito
So the stories you wrote...

I'm the one who breaks the silence.
Yonagi
Mhm?
Kaito
They were all stories that ended in separation.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Yonagi
Yeah, back then I wrote them because I wanted to prepare myself for us to separate.
Yonagi
I just couldn't write any other conclusions to them.
Kaito
But now...
Kaito
Your own story didn't end in separation.
Yonagi
Yeah, that's right.
Kaito
I'd like those three to be happy too.

She raises her head and looks up at me.
Kaito
And I'd like to tell everyone about their stories, starting tomorrow.
Kaito
Don't you think it'd be nice to give them happy epilogues?

Her smile widens as I finish speaking.
Yonagi
Epilogues, huh?
Yonagi
Okay, I'll make them now.
Yonagi
Which one do you wanna hear first?
