Kaito
Nnh... H-Huh?
Izumo
Good morning.
Kaito
Uh, where's Yonagi?
Izumo
She's already awake.
Kaito
Oh, I see.

I've gotten accustomed to waking up to Yonagi peering into my face.

But today I'm met with the ceiling.

It makes me feel slightly sad.
Kaito
...

I stare at her empty bed for a moment.

When I raise my face, I meet Izumo's eyes as she looks down at me.
Izumo
I believe she went out to the rooftop.
Kaito
Huh? Really?

She nods.
Kaito
But didn't she say she doesn't like being out there?
Izumo
She's changing, little by little.
Kaito
I see.

That person in the dream resembles her.

The things that happen as the dream progresses are changing her.

I've started to get a vague sense of what this experiment is about.
Kaito
I want to see her.
Kaito
Can I?
Izumo
Of course.
Izumo
Let's go to the rooftop.

I rise from the bed and put on my sandals.

When the elevator doors open and I step out onto the rooftop, I see Yonagi's back.

Wooleep is hovering behind her.

She's just looking at the sky.

I chase her gaze with mine.

I look up at the round, starry sky.

It feels so close you could reach out and touch it, but not quite.

The surface and the wind are so near, yet so far.

Wild greenery spreads out beyond the circular lens.

I look turn my gaze back down to Yonagi.

Noticing my approaching footsteps, she turns around.
Yonagi
Ah...
Kaito
Good morning.
Yonagi
Good morning?

I stand next to her, resting my elbows on the railing.

She watches me attentively.
Yonagi
...

Then she grabs me by the cheeks and turns my face towards hers.
Kaito
Ngh...
Yonagi
Kaito.

I nod, still sandwiched between her hands.
Yonagi
Kaito.
Kaito
That's me.

She nods.

Finally, she slowly peels her hands away from my cheeks.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
Do you recognize me?

Yonagi shakes her head.

Then she raises her hand and points at my face.
Yonagi
Kaito.

Then she points at herself.
Yonagi
Yonagi.
Yonagi
That's it.

I answer her with a nod.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
What are you doing out here?
Yonagi
Looking at the sky.
Kaito
Aren't you cold?
Yonagi
A little.
Kaito
The air isn't that good out here. Maybe we should go inside.
Yonagi
But I want to look at the sky.
Yonagi
I wanted to make sure it was there.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
...I'm hungry.
Izumo
Would you like to eat?
Yonagi
Yes.
Yonagi
I'm thirsty.
Izumo
Let's go inside.
Kaito
Not yet. I need to talk to you, Izumo.

Izumo gives me a level stare.
Izumo
Wooleep, with Yonagi.
Shleep
*Affirmative chirp*

Wooleep hovers ahead of Yonagi to guide her.

She follows after the little floating robot back to the elevator.
Kaito
...

Once the door closes, we're the only ones left on the rooftop.
Kaito
She's changed.
Izumo
Yes.
Kaito
Does it have something to do with the dream I'm having?
Izumo
...
Kaito
Otherwise, you wouldn't need to bother monitoring my dreams.
Kaito
The only one who changes each time I wake up is Yonagi.
Izumo
...
Kaito
You don't need to answer.
Kaito
In fact, I feel like your silence is an answer in and of itself.
Izumo
What do you mean?
Kaito
If I wasn't close to the truth, you would deny what I'm saying.
Izumo
...
Kaito
There's only one thing I want to ask.

I stare at her face.
Kaito
If I keep dreaming, will you be able to help that girl?
Kaito
Is this experiment being done for Yonagi's sake?
Izumo
Yes.
Izumo
It will save her.
Kaito
What's wrong with her?
Izumo
I cannot answer that question right now.
Kaito
Did I know, before I lost my memory?

She nods.
Kaito
I see... So that must mean...
Kaito
I agreed to help with this experiment because I wanted to help her.

She keeps her steady, neutral gaze on me.
Kaito
And even as I am now, I want to see her grow.
Kaito
But...
Kaito
How many times have we repeated this exchange?
Kaito
How many times have I had my memories wiped and kept dreaming?
Izumo
We have only cleaned your memory once.
Kaito
...Not like I have much choice but to believe whatever you tell me.
Kaito
You said it yourself. You can lie if you need to.
Kaito
I have no choice but to believe.
Izumo
But you're the one who said that an actual liar would never admit to being one.

The comment rips a chuckle out of me.

I detect a hint of bewilderment in Izumo.

Or perhaps I'm just imagining things again.

Perhaps I'm just seeing what I want to see, attributing emotions where there are none.
