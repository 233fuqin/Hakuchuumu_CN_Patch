The room Izumi guides me to is filled with children's toys and board games.

And in the middle of it, Yonagi is...
Kaito
Are those paints?
Izumo
It seems so, yes.
Kaito
What's she doing over there?

I slowly approach her.

She looks up at me as I come closer.
Kaito
Are you painting your nails?
Yonagi
...Nails.
Kaito
You're painting them?

She nods.
Shleep
*Chirp*

She's painting the nails of her left hand one by one.
Yonagi
Uh...
Kaito
Mm?

Yonagi frowns down at her nails for a moment.

Then she picks up one paint bottle, examines it, and puts it back on the floor before moving on to the next.
Yonagi
Sparkly sparkly... Sparkly...
Kaito
Sparkly? Ah...

I reach out and pick up the pot of glittery paint.
Kaito
Is this the one you're looking for?
Yonagi
Sparkly!

She swipes the paint out of my hand and resumes painting her nails.
Yonagi
Ah! Sparkly!
Kaito
...She's just like a kid.
Shleep
*Chirp*
Kaito
...
