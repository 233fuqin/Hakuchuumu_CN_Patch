Today, after rehearsal.

Olivia's fidgeting while keeping her distance from Kiki and Thomas.
Kiki
Phew!
Thomas
I'm beat.
Kiki
Same. Let's go.
Thomas
You stopping by the usual place today?
Kiki
You know it! Can't get by without a drink.
Thomas
Hahah, same.
Olivia
...Wait.
Kiki&Thomas
Huh?
Olivia
Just, wait. Wait, all of you.
Olivia
Wait... Stop right there and don't move.
Kiki
We're waiting?

Come on!

You can do it, Olivia Berry!
Olivia
Y-Yes, I can see that. Y-You're not gonna get anything from me by standing there like a bunch of halfwits!

Olivia, no!
Kiki
Huh?!
Olivia
No, that's not what I want to say. Keep it together, Olivia.
Thomas
Aren't we done here, ma'am?
Olivia
Yes, the rehearsal is over. But you still can't leave.
Olivia
Because you're all my bloody slaves!

Noooooooo!
Olivia
No, that's not it! We're going today. You're coming with me to... drink.
Thomas
Drink?
Kiki
Drink what?
Olivia
Ale, what else?!

Almost there!
Olivia
...

Olivia turns to me, her eyes blazing.

I look away.

This is her job as a leader.

I pray you can find the strength within you, Olivia!
Olivia
Will's home is a small, dirty pub, you see. Today, you are all coming with me to pay a visit.
Kiki
Uh, why?
Olivia
Silence!
Thomas
But...
Olivia
No buts!
Kiki&Thomas
...

Kiki and Thomas exchange glances, completely flabbergasted.

The scene makes me titter.
Olivia
...!

Olivia's head snaps back to me, and she walks up to me with her arm held high.
Will
No, you're doing well, Oli—

She slaps me across the face with the force of a thousand suns.
Will
Why?!
Olivia
Because I felt like it! Hurry and guide us there. It's your bloody pub.
Will
O-Okay.
Kiki
Well, we have no choice but to go, right?
Thomas
Certainly looks that way.

With the rest of the troupe in tow, Olivia and I walk to the pub.
Kiki
Whoa!
Thomas
This ain't half bad.
Kiki
Yeah! This looks cozy! I love it when a place looks like trash but the food is actually good!
Olivia
Don't be stupid. It may be good now, but it was barely edible when I set foot in here for the first time.
Will
That hurts.
Kiki
Huh? This is Will's home, right?
Will
Yeah, but Olivia's the one who cooks.
Thomas
Huh?
Kiki
Why?
Thomas
You live here together?
Olivia
You really think I could live in a rat hole like this? The bed is hard, and the pillows could pass as sandbags.
Kiki
So you have stayed the night, then.
Thomas
Whoa, color me surprised.
Kiki
Right?
Olivia
It just happened, okay?! Stop gossiping and come help! Take down the chairs, wipe the tables and the counter! Make it quick!
Kiki&Thomas
Aye, ma'am.
Will
Olivia, don't make them work. We brought them here to drink.

After a while, my dad comes down the stairs.
Father
Hm? Busy early today, eh?
Kiki
Someone came down the stairs!
Will
That's my dad. He's the owner of this place, kinda.
Father
Will, who are these people?
Will
Troupe friends.
Thomas
Friends?
Kiki
We are?

Kiki and Thomas exchange glances.
Olivia
He can't see very well. Don't just stand there, Thomas!
Thomas
Ah, my bad.

Olivia shouts at Thomas, and he quickly gets out of Dad's usual route to his seat.
Olivia
Kiki, help him walk.
Kiki
Ah, yes, ma'am.
Father
Oh, sorry to bother you all.
Kiki
Don't you worry!
Father
What a lovely lass. Truly, it's a shame my eyes can't see.
Kiki
I'm a boy, though?
Father
Huh? A boy?! With that voice?!
Kiki
Yes, I have a dingle dangle as well.
Father
Dingle Dangle? What does that mean?!
Kiki
Yes, see?

Kiki puts my father's hand over his crotch.
Father
Hah, I'd say you are simply dangling my chain, lass.
Kiki
How rude! Have a touch and see for yourself!
Kiki
Come on, feel it now?!
Will
For the love of God, Kiki, what are you doing to my father?!

When the pub opens, Olivia's regulars are quick to fill the remaining seats.

The members of the troupe sit at the counter together.

All of them look on in pure disbelief as Olivia serves the customers.
Kiki
So kind...
Thomas
She's not shouting...
Kiki
It looks like she's having fun.
Thomas
She looks so friendly too.
Kiki&Thomas
Like she's a different person...
Will
Shocking, isn't it?
Thomas
Shocking doesn't do this justice.
Kiki
I think this may be the first time I've actually seen her smile.
Rob
Whoa, we're full up, eh?
Olivia
We kept one spot for you at the bar. That's your seat, right?
Rob
Oh, considerate as always, I see!
Will
Ale, right?
Rob
Aye. Hey, what's with these people?
Father
Will and Olivia's friends, it seems.
Rob
Oh? So that means...

Rob stares at Kiki, who's seated next to him.
Kiki
Yes, I'm a boy. Thank you.
Rob
This adorable lass is a boy?!
Kiki
Yes, I have a dingle dangle.
Rob
Dingle dangle? The dangly bits?! You have those?! It can't be!
Father
She'll let you touch if you ask nicely.
Kiki
Yes, feel free to see for yourself. I'm happy to quell your doubts.
Rob
Uh, I think I'll take your word for it.
Rob
I am actually, uh, scared of how much I want to take him up on that offer.
Father
It was a rather cute dingle dangle, I'll have you know.
Rob
You went and touched it, you senile old dog?!
Father
Indeed. It felt like not a dangle at all. Truly a mysterious experience.
Kiki
It was a dingle dangle, though?!

The pub stays busy for a while, but as the night rolls on, vacant seats start opening up.
Will
Come join us, Olivia.
Olivia
Mm, okay, I'm coming.

Olivia stands beside the counter.
Olivia
...
Kiki
...
Thomas
...
Will
How about we all share a toast together?
Kiki
Yeah, good idea!
Father
This can be on the house, Will. You all worked hard today, so I'd say you deserve it.
Olivia
While I'm grateful for your consideration, I know the pub can't afford to hand out free drinks.
Olivia
It's my troupe, so I'll pay.
Rob
Are you the patron of the troupe, Olivia?
Will
Yeah, something like that.

I can hardly say that Olivia's a fellow performer.
Will
Right, everyone?
Thomas
Ah, yes.
Kiki
Of course. Olivia has no dingle dangle, after all. You took a look between her legs already, didn't you, Will?
Rob
I see, so you're the patron together with Spencer, then. Are you two married, perchance?
Olivia
We are not married.
Rob
Huh. Engaged, then?
Olivia
...Perhaps.
Will
Everyone's good with ale, right?
Kiki
Yes!
Thomas
No problem here!
Will
How long have you two known each other?
Kiki
That's a good question.
Thomas
Ever since we began burgling together in London, remember? It's been what, fifteen years since then?
Kiki
Whoa, that's a long time.
Olivia
Fifteen years?! Wait a moment, how old are you, Kiki?!
Kiki
Tehehee!
Thomas
Older than me, right?
Will
Excuse me?!
Olivia
You can't be human...
Rob
What, you two are thieves?
Thomas
Ex-thieves, mind you.
Kiki
And we made a point to steal only from noblemen.
Thomas
Along the way, we realized that deceiving nobles was easier than stealing from them.
Kiki
Yeah, so we started selling them shiny baubles and rocks. Fake jewels.
Thomas
And they flew out of our hands. Those nobles are a bunch of damn fools!
Kiki
But Spencer busted us.
Olivia
His aesthetic sense is a level above that of your average aristocrat. If there's one person who can see that everything which glitters is not gold, it's him.
Olivia
When he sees something he deems beautiful, he loses sight of everything else. In a sense, he's pretty pure.
Olivia
But he has no mercy for anything he doesn't deem beautiful. Bringing such crudely fashioned fake jewels before him was the same as asking to have your heads cut off.
Kiki
Now, that was scary.
Thomas
It was more creepy than scary. He didn't make any sense.
Kiki
Yeah, I didn't even know what he was talking about.
Will
So, Olivia paid for you two before he could have your heads cut off?
Olivia
Don't most stories have characters like these two? A pair of bumbling fools tripping their way into trouble.
Father
Hahahah, right you are!
Thomas
If we got roles like that, we'd hardly need to act!
Kiki
We'd fit right in, eh?
Will
Fit right in...

I see, so you can put people in roles that fit them so it's easier for them to adapt.

I fold my arms and think.

Perhaps we're doing something fundamentally wrong in that regard?
Rob
Is the play you guys are rehearsing the same one I had Will write the script for?
Will
Huh? Ah, yes. The same one.
Rob
It's based on that real life rumor I heard on my travels through Italy, is it not?
Kiki
Rumor?
Rob
This lad here has a downright scary memory.
Rob
More than a good memory, I believe he's incapable of forgetting stuff.
Will
I suppose that's fair to say.
Rob
So, the peddlers who come here aren't only locals from Tenbridge; there are also those who travel around different countries, like me.
Rob
And this lad here remembers every single offhand story they tell.
Will
Some are talkative fellows like Rob who like to gossip over a drink, and others are booksellers.
Will
Books are too expensive for me to buy, but while they're here, I memorize the contents of all the books they bring with them to sell to the nobles.
Rob
Now that you're using them as material to write your own plays, it feels kind of suspect, eh?
Kiki
That's one heck of a story!
Thomas
That's one type of stealing no one will bust you for.
Olivia
Don't be foolish. It's not something just anyone could replicate.
Olivia
Besides, only someone with Will's talent would be able to take all the elements that work from so many sources and put them together to create a wholly new story. He's the only one capable of that.
Father
If only he had the same competence for running a pub.
Olivia
It beggars belief, truly.
Rob
So, what kind of story did you end up making from my silly rumor?
Olivia
Come see it for yourself. The premiere is next week.
Rob
Eh? That's so soon!
Father
Theater, eh? I sure wish I could go see Will's play.
Will
...

I glance at my dad.

Olivia also directs a sympathetic look his way.
Father
Ah, worry not. I don't need anything more from life after touching Kiki's dingle dangle.
Kiki
Yes! My dingle dangle is a lot cuter than Will's crossdressing.
Will
Can you stop saying that word? It's gonna give me nightmares.
Olivia
...You all remember your lines, right?
Kiki
Huh?
Thomas
S-Somewhat?
Will
Why?
Olivia
Let's recite our lines. It'll be good practice to focus only on the words.
Rob
Oh! We get a sneak peek?!
Olivia
Just a little public practice. Don't expect much, though—most of us are ham actors, sadly.
Rob
You hear that, Boss? Looks like we get to hear Will's play!
Lysander
There, gentle Hermia, my love for thee is eternal! May I marry thee?
Hermia
My good Lysander! I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow. To-morrow truly will I meet with thine, and our eternal will become!
Puck
Phew, that's one pair down.
Helena
Ah, Demetrius. Finally, my love for thee has made thee see the light!
Lysander
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past. Perhaps we were blessed with everlasting love by the summer's court over this midsummer night.
Helena
Oh, Demetrius. Ne'er leave my side once more!
Lysander
Let us go, Hermia. Before the morrow our vows will be sealed!
Hermia
Y-Yes, my love!
Puck
Why, then, finally all are awake! No more yielding but a dream, a gift, they say! Truly, all they did was have a silly midsummer night's dream! Courtesy of yours truly!
Rob
Hahah, I see now.
Father
So that's how the play goes. It's a fun story, yes.

We hold an impromptu recitation of the lines for my blind father.

Olivia decided to fill in the role of one of the actors who couldn't come to the pub.

Or that's the excuse we gave, since she's the main character.
Rob
But Thomas and Kiki, you're definitely not very good at this acting thing, eh?
Thomas
I've got no talent, that's for sure.
Kiki
I can't do much else than stand around and look cute.
Rob
Hey, Will! You based this Puck fairy on that mischievous kid, right?
Will
Yeah.
Rob
What did you think, Boss?
Father
Hm? During the whole thing, I was thinking...
Father
...that Kiki should be playing Puck.
Rob
I agree.
Olivia
...
Kiki
...
Will
...
Kiki
B-But, me? A mischievous kid? But I'm so cuuute!
Rob
But he's a bloke, right?
Father
How about we coin the word femboy? You know, as in a femme-like boy?
Rob
Boss, the day a sinful word like that catches on, it'll be the end of the world as we know it.
Father
Heh, indeed.
Will
Yeah... Puck the fairy should have a cuteness that transcends gender.
Will
If Puck becomes the main attraction of the play with Kiki in the role, I'm sure it'll get the audience talking and excited.
Olivia
But then what do we do about Helena?
Will
Thomas will be Helena.
Thomas
Huh? I gotta crossdress?!
Olivia
Isn't that going to seem a little forced?
Will
It's the same thing we were talking about earlier. If we have Thomas dress up as Helena, her serious scenes won't feel so heavy.
Will
Hermia's beloved is stolen from her by Helena, remember? What if Helena looks like Thomas?
Olivia
It would be the biggest of jokes.
Thomas
Yeah... Wait, isn't that an insult?!
Kiki
Me as Puck? I wonder if it could work...
Olivia
Will, can you write down Puck and Helena's lines?
Will
Sure can.
Olivia
It's okay if you have to read from the script, Thomas, Kiki. Let's give it one more try.
Lysander
There, gentle Hermia, my love for thee is eternal! May I marry thee?
Hermia
My good Lysander! I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow. To-morrow truly will I meet with thine, and our eternal will become!
Puck
Phew, that's one pair down.
Helena
Ah, Demetrius. Finally, my love for thee has made thee see the light!
Rob
Pffft!
Father
Ahahahah!
Lysander
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past. Perhaps we were blessed with everlasting love by the summer's court over this midsummer night.
Helena
Oh, Demetrius. Ne'er leave my side once more!
Father
Hah, ahahahah! *Cough*!
Rob
This is a bloody riot! Keep it coming! Ahahahah!
Lysander
Let us go, Hermia. Before the morrow our vows will be sealed!
Hermia
Y-Yes, my love!
Puck
Why, then, finally all are awake! No more yielding but a dream, a gift,  they say! Truly, all they did was have a silly midsummer night's dream! Courtesy of yours truly!
Father
*Cough* Hah, hahahah! Yes, that's great!
Rob
This is a damn spectacle! Way better than before!
Will
Olivia.
Olivia
Yes.

Olivia turns to Kiki and Thomas.
Olivia
While I can't in good conscience praise your acting, Thomas...
Olivia
I can at least tell you for certain that your acting will make the audience feel something.
Olivia
It wasn't bad. Let's keep this change of roles.

Kiki and Thomas flush in embarrassment.
Kiki
We got praised?
Thomas
Us? By the leader?
Rob
Hey, Helena! The blush doesn't suit you!
Father
Ahahahah!
Will
How was it? Did you have fun?

Both of them seem stunned by the sudden words of encouragement.
Kiki
Yeah, it kind of felt like the lines came naturally to me.
Thomas
Me too!
Father
Damn liar!
Will
I'm glad. When I wrote the lines, I was imagining the two of you and how you usually are.
Kiki
I see.
Will
You're not playing Puck; Puck was modeled after you.
Will
So this Puck can only be played by you. These lines are for your Puck.
Kiki
For me, huh?
Will
It's the same for Helena, of course.
Thomas
...

Thomas' cheeks flush a rosy pink.

Oddly enough, Thomas is a lot more feminine than I thought. I'm honestly surprised.
Olivia
You can take these new scripts. Have them memorized by tomorrow. You can manage that, right?
Kiki
Yeah!
Thomas
I'll try most valiantly!
Olivia
Good boys.

Olivia smiles, keeping her eyes fixed on the happy group.

I stare at her profile for a while.

After a moment, she notices my gaze and turns to me with a displeased expression on her face.
Olivia
What are you staring at?
Will
Nothing.
Olivia
You're getting too big for your boots as of late.
Will
Sorry about that. I am but a lowly slave, Lady Olivia.
Olivia
Yeah, you're the image of subservience, all right. There's no need to 'lady' me.
Will
You honor me, my lady.
Olivia
Oh, shut up.

I break into pure laughter.

She pouts, but her lips settle into a sweet smile after a few seconds.
Will
One more thing.
Olivia
Mm?
Will
I finished the first draft.

Her eyes widen upon hearing that.

Then her rose-colored irises light up in expectation.
Will
It's called...
Will
...Hamlet.

We leave everyone making merry in the pub and head to my room together.

Olivia reads the manuscript in silence.

Her eyes sparkle with interest.

It's enough to tell me that I was able to meet her expectations.
Olivia
Will.
Will
Yes?
Olivia
You're a bloody genius. I love you.
Will
...

It makes my heart skip a beat, but there is no feeling behind the words. An aggressive smile spreads from ear to ear on her face, as if something has taken possession of her.
Olivia
Your dialogues have improved. This is a far cry from the first draft of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Reading this, I can clearly envision how it'll look on stage.
Olivia
You now have a good grasp of how actors move around the stage.
Will
Thanks to you.
Olivia
However...

Olivia looks at the last page of the manuscript.
Olivia
The final climax is somewhat weak. Killing everyone with poisoned wine feels like a waste.
Olivia
Kill only one with the poison. It'll have more of an impact that way.
Will
The mother, then.
Olivia
I think that's the best, yes. She could drink from the wine while being aware there's poison in it. Perhaps a shred of maternal instinct drives her to choose suicide.
Will
I see.

In the last scene, Hamlet's uncle tries to take his nephew's life. That is to say, the man who killed his father and married his mother poisons Hamlet's wine.

Upon becoming aware of this, his mother drinks the wine to protect him.

It's a good idea for a proper end to the tragedy.
Olivia
Because Ophelia loved Hamlet, she's swallowed by his madness and loses her life, right?

I nod.
Olivia
Then, I think the finale should be a duel between Hamlet and Laertes.
Olivia
The story can't end until the man who loved Ophelia as a woman and the man who loved her as a sister confront one another.
Will
...Right.
Olivia
Mm?
Will
I did consider that, but we don't have much time to rehearse. The Admiral's Men are the only troupe who can really pull off sword play scenes, right?
Olivia
And they're our biggest rivals, remember? Are we supposed to simply cower before them?
Will
But we only have ten days to rehearse this. The sword play would make it flashier, but we can make do with it as it is, no?
Olivia
We're doing it. Rewrite the scene.
Will
You're gonna be Hamlet, right?

Olivia nods.
Will
You may be able to handle yourself, but you need two for a sword fight. If the other person lacks training, you could get seriously hurt.
Olivia
There is no play without pain, Will. Write it in. This scene will go down in history.
Olivia
I guarantee so.
Will
...
Olivia
You would ruin this story over a few flesh wounds for the actors?
Will
...
Olivia
I will bear the responsibility as your troupe leader. I've no intention of getting sloppy with the training, so just write it. I want no hesitation on your part.
Olivia
Understood?

I blow a sigh of resignation.
Will
All right.
Olivia
Good boy.

I take my quill and sit at the desk.

It's been a week since we adjusted the cast roles.

We've finished rehearsing.

As the quality of rehearsals improved, so too did the quality of the play.

And now, at last, it's premiere day.

A mood of excited tension can be felt in the faces of all the troupe members.

The theater is full.

But there's a certain feeling of unequivocal hostility that makes it hard to believe this is our own theater.

The news of my scuffle with Marlowe spread not only among the theater crowd, but across all of Tenbridge.

A feud between the best of Tenbridge, the Admiral's Men.

And Spencer's troupe, led by Olivia and infamous for their shoddy acting.

The Globe theater is filled with sneers and loud mocking comments.

We all form a small circle behind the stage.
Olivia
It's a full house out there. Feels exhilarating, doesn't it?
Kiki
Hahah...
Thomas
Are we gonna be okay?
Olivia
Oh, are you mayhaps nervous, you two?
Kiki
Yeah...
Thomas
Can't deny that.
Olivia
Yes, and I will tell you why. You cannot wait to overturn this tense atmosphere and make the stage yours.
Olivia
Acting is no longer simply about killing time for you.
Olivia
You want to show off all the effort you've put into it these past weeks. But you're afraid about whether or not you'll be able to pull it off perfectly, like so many times during rehearsal.
Olivia
That's why you're nervous.
Kiki
...
Thomas
...
Olivia
Congratulations, my friends. Today is the day you walk onto that stage as true actors for the first time.
Olivia
That goes for you as well, Will.
Will
...Yeah.
Olivia
Worry not, I will masterfully cover for all of your mistakes. Thankfully for you, the leader of this troupe was born to stand on the stage.
Olivia
We can do it, understood?
Kiki&Thomas
Yes!
Olivia
Good boys.
Kiki
Welcome one and all! Today, I, the fairy Puck, have the pleasure of presenting this foolish night of love between two men and women to you!
Spectator 1
Blimey, how cute!
Spectator 2
I can barely believe me eyes! Hark at that cutie!
Kiki
Love... As ephemeral and luscious as a Midsummer Night's Dream.
Spectator 1
By my fay! This must be folly! How can such cuteness be contained in a body?!
Kiki
These four love-seeking souls lose themselves in the forest on a May night.
Spectator 2
But only men can act, right? What is the meaning of this?
Spectator 1
Huh? You mean to say the lass is a bloke with dangly bits? Thou art cupshot, friend!
Kiki
In their hearts, a love for each other burns.

Yesterday, I added some introduction lines for Kiki to recite.

The plan is to hook them in with Kiki and hold their interest by making them look forward to him appearing again.

After the introduction, we can feel the attention of the whole venue converged on us.

The next part seems to be over in the blink of an eye.

I go up on the stage and play the Hermia I based off Olivia's mannerisms. I can immediately tell my performance takes the audience's breath away.

Breath that Thomas, as Helena, proceeds to turn into laughter in mere seconds.

It's a series of up and downs between tension and loud laughter.

Olivia's performance pulls it all together so the interest doesn't fizzle out at any point.

The Midsummer Night's Dream that we created ended up as a play with a wide range of emotional fluctuations.
Lysander
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past. Perhaps we were blessed with everlasting love by the summer's court over this midsummer night.
Helena
Oh, Demetrius. Ne'er leave my side once more!
Spectator 1
Ahahahah! Helena, you look like a dried cow's tongue!
Spectator 2
Don't wiggle near me!
Lysander
Let us go, Hermia. Before the morrow our vows will be sealed!
Hermia
Yes, my love!

Then, Kiki pops up from the wing of the stage.

The audience immediately begins cheering for him.
Puck
Why, then, finally all are awake! No more yielding but a dream, a gift,  they say! Truly, all they did was have a silly midsummer night's dream! Courtesy of yours truly!
Spectator 1
Puck, me love!
Spectator 2
Look over here! Let us see that smile!
Puck
Eheheh!
Spectator 1&Spectator 2
Ah, be still me beatin' heart!
Kiki
Wasn't that incredible?!
Thomas
They liked it that much?!
Olivia
Of course they did. We put in the work, didn't we?

Even Olivia looks besides herself with joy.

To be quite honest, I'm relieved.

While we were still rehearsing, I dreamed several times that all our jokes fell flat.

But the audience liked the play more than I ever dared to imagine.
Kiki
It's amazing. They're still cheering.
Thomas
It just doesn't stop.
Olivia
Will.
Will
Huh?
Olivia
They're waiting for you. Get out there.
Kiki
Yeah, they're not gonna calm down until the bard shows his face!
Thomas
Looks like you got more work to do, pretty boy.
Will
Are you sure I should go?
Olivia
Who else but you? Go now. Make sure this audience won't forget your face for as long as they live.
Olivia
This part is yours to play too, William Shakespeare.
Will
...

As I step onto the stage, the cheers come louder, like a gust lifting me up into the air.

I can't help but smile at them.
Will
...

Oh, are you watching me from up there, Ed?

It's just as you said.

Our story reached the hearts of so many tonight.

You can see it from where you are, can't you?

I raise my hands to acknowledge their jubilant applause.

Which only makes the cheering grow even more intense.

I regard the audience on the ground floor.

Then I turn to salute the ones in the second and third floors.

Someone calls my name.

My name is now engraved in the memories of all the audience members as the author of this play.

The Globe buzzes with the pure excitement emanating from the crowd.

And here I am, basking in their unbridled adoration.

Olivia was right...

Surely, a man can grow addicted to such a thing.

A pleasure that overshadows even making love to a woman.

...Not that I would know.

I can't tell for certain, sadly.

But...

It certainly is the best moment of my life.

I turn backstage.

Olivia is clapping, a pleased smile gracing her face from ear to ear.

Looking at that smile...

I realize that perhaps it's the reason I have been writing stories up to this day.

When the realization dawns upon me, all the sounds become muted around me.

She's beaming, smiling with her whole face. Her bright rose eyes shimmer like jewels in the shadows behind the stage.

I stare right into her eyes.

She gives me a short nod.

In a daze, I lose myself in her eyes.

Olivia keeps clapping her hands joyfully.

After a while, she explodes in laughter.

With an amused smile on her face, she points me to the audience with her chin.

But looking at anything but her smile would be the gravest of sins for me.

I want to stay in this mute world, watching her smile for all eternity.

There is no wish more fervent in my heart.

Alas, the roaring cheer pulls me back to reality.

I turn back to the audience.

And I raise my arms towards them again.

They keep calling my name in standing ovation.

I'm glad to be able to write.

I'm happy I joined this troupe.

I'm infinitely thankful to Olivia for showing me the world beyond my narrow counter.

I'm glad we met that night. Of that, I am certain.
Will
And that's what happened.
Kiki
Our premiere was a smashing success!
Rob
Ooh!
Will
And it's time to celebrate, of course.

...But I don't see Olivia anywhere.
Kiki
Where's the leader? Oh, I don't see Thomas around either.
Will
Thomas sure takes a long time to take off the make up. He's not used to dealing with dresses yet either.
Rob
Ahahaha! He could give a show to our customers here!
Father
Hah, it really went that well tonight?
Kiki
It was the best night ever! There were even some members of the audience looking for me after it was all said and done! They wanted to drown me with praise personally!
Rob
Ahahaha! And you're happy about that?!
Will
It's fine. I'm sure the audience will talk Kiki up all around town.
Will
And the ones who get attached to him will keep coming back for more.
Father
But won't people get bored of seeing the same play all the time?
Will
In the meantime, we'll rehearse for a tragedy to change up the mood from today's comedy.
Will
That'll shake up the audience and get the whole city talking about us.
Will
It seems that the Queen decides which troupe will perform for the court next based on what plays people in town are talking about, so we're trying to get our name out there.
Will
We don't have a huge repertoire of plays to draw from like the Admiral's Men just yet, so that's our best shot.
Rob
I see.
Father
If you used a tenth of that sagacity to run this pub, I bet we'd have a branch in the middle of the fountain square by now.
Will
I'm not made for this kind of work, and you know that.
Father
Better than anyone.
Rob
Can't deny it.
Kiki
Do you know what this tragedy will be about already?
Will
Yeah, I finished writing it. Actually, I wanted to talk about it tonight.
Will
But they're taking so long. Should we begin without them?
Kiki
It'd feel wrong to begin without our leader here.

Kiki says, his shoulders drooping a little.

Seeing his disappointment brings a smile to my face. We're a real team now, I feel.
Will
I'll go fetch them. They must still be at the theater. Let's see if she doesn't bite my head off for trying to give her orders.
Kiki
See you in the other life, just in case!
Father
No more deer stealing attempts, you hear me?
Will
I won't, thanks for the concern. You can wait here for us. Drink all you want, just don't get drunk.
Kiki
Nah, I think I'll wait.
Olivia
Hah...

At last.

Finally, I made it.

The ear splitting cheers.

The satisfaction painted on the faces of the audience.

As soon as I close my eyes, they come back to me as clear as the light of day.

The stars look so near, as if I could reach out and touch them.

Will kept his promise.

I wanted him to do whatever it took to move me to tears.

That's what I ordered him to do when we met.

And he kept his promise, and did so much more.

On the day of our first performance.

He's a great man.

No, he became a great man.

He overcame all the challenges I had him face these last few days.

I remember the day he tried to steal the deer.

The way his eyes resembled those of a lost child brings a smile to my face.

That sheen of anxiety is gone from them now.

Today, he stood on the stage as a man, imposing and respectable.

I need to be careful around him from now on, or he might very well end up stealing my breath away.

His Hermia was beautiful beyond words.

I wipe away the tears pooling at the corners of my eyes.

I can't be seen by the other troupe members being this sentimental.

We merely took our first step.

With them by my side, I am sure we can aim for the moon.
??
Leader.
Olivia
Ah!
Olivia
Oh, Thomas. Don't sneak up on me like that. What is it?
Thomas
It takes me so long to take off the make up. It just won't come off!
Olivia
Get used to it. You'd just sweat it away if we didn't cake it on like that.
Thomas
Yes, ma'am. We're going to Will's pub now, right?
Olivia
Ah, yes, yes. I need to change first. You go on ahead.
Thomas
Yes, ma'am.
Olivia
Don't you go starting the party without me.
Thomas
Understood, ma'am.
Olivia
Mm...

I watch the lanky man scratching his face as he walks away.

I still find it hard to believe that he can perform a comical role so well.

We could add a jester like him to any play we make.

Even in a tragedy, you need to a character to add some levity to the proceedings.

I never imagined the day would come when he would become an invaluable asset to our troupe.

When Thomas is gone, I turn to the wings of the stage.
??
Olive.
Olivia
*Sigh* What now?!

When I turn around...

I find myself staring at the person who I want to see the least in the world.

Why? Why now?

I bite my lip and repress the shudders threatening to rack my body.
Olivia
...Lord Spencer.
Spencer
I saw it all, Olive. It was a most curiously exciting display.
Olivia
I suppose...
Spencer
That deer loving chico is the one who wrote that? What was his name? Ah, yes, Shakespeare.
Olivia
Yes.
Spencer
You were absolutely right. He certainly was able to show something more hermoso than his head on a pike.
Olivia
Your words honor me.
Spencer
And that girl was quite nice as well. Puck the fairy, was it? They were extremely linda.
Spencer
Is she like you? A chica pretending to have a cute little amigo down there?
Olivia
No, he's a man, Lord Spencer.
Spencer
Hoo! Bellisimo! So that means that the chico has an amigo dangling between his legs?
Spencer
Pecking at it like a lindo pajaro would be most exciting, wouldn't you say?
Spencer
Do bring him along so he can entertain me one of these days.
Olivia
Yes... If circumstances allow...
Spencer
But, I do believe the one that brillo the brightest...
Spencer
...was you, Olive.
Olivia
Again, your words honor me.
Spencer
Watching you dress as a chico was most thrilling... Ah, I want to hold you in my arms. Defile that otherworldly beauty that is neither man nor woman.
Spencer
Ahora mismo, right now.
Olivia
Please, Lord Spencer, not here...
Spencer
Que? What did you say, Olive?
Olivia
I am quite fatigued from the intensive rehearsals, and the troupe members are always coming and going—
Spencer
Para, stop. Olive, who am I?
Olivia
...

I can feel a building ire behind his words.

Even now...

Hearing that tone makes my body tense reflexively.

I'm so pathetic.

I hate that I yield to this man out of fear. Hate it with every fiber of my being.
Spencer
Quien soy yo? Who am I?
Olivia
Lord Harold Spencer.
Spencer
Si, and you are Olivia Berry. You are my...?
Olivia
...
Spencer
Answer, Olive. I want to hear it from your labios.
Olivia
...Your slave.
Spencer
That's what I thought. Don't you ever forget our reglas, our rules. This theater also belongs to me.
Spencer
What happens to MY esclava inside of MY theater is for ME to decide.
Spencer
ME, ME, ME, y nadie mas que ME!
Olivia
I beg you. Please spare me, just for today.
Olivia
My troupe members are waiting for me. I beg for lenience, my Lord.

I lower my head to him.

I don't want this.

Not today.

Just this one day.

I want to enjoy this happiness Will gave me.

I don't want it to be crumpled and broken like this.

Not like this...

I don't want my memories of this day to be marred by this man. I don't want to remember this day as yet another one where I was violated.
Olivia
Please, I beg you...
Spencer
Let's go inside, Olive.

Spencer yanks my arm and drags me backstage.
Olivia
Ah!
Spencer
Didn't I tell you that there would be no mercy next time?
Spencer
Go inside and take off your trousers. Keep the top on. I feel like doing it with a chico today.
Spencer
That's an order.

His whisper freezes me to the core.

This man's voice is a curse.

A curse that robs my body of its freedom.
Olivia
...Yes.

Doing as he says, I turn on my heels and walk to the antechamber.
Will
Hah... Hah...

I run back to the theater.

By all accounts, I should be tired, but I feel strangely light on my feet.

Even my labored breaths feel wonderful in my chest.

I notice another figure running down the street, heading in my direction.

I can't help but smile.
Thomas
Oh, is that you, Will?

The familiar lanky man swaggers his way down the street.
Will
Where's the leader?
Thomas
Still at the theater. She was spacing out back there.

My smile turns a little bitter.

Is she still basking in today's success?

That's the Olivia I know.
Thomas
Where's everyone else?
Will
Waiting at the pub. You go on ahead, I'll bring her over.
Thomas
Got that, my good man. See you there.

The theater comes into view.

It's hard to believe that this quiet place was full of cheer and joy until not so long ago.

I hurry through the gates, impatient to see her.
Will
Huh?

But she's nowhere to be seen.

It's a little late to be changing clothes.

I know for a fact that she more than any of us wanted today's play to be a success.

I was certain she'd be standing by herself on the stage getting sentimental.

I'm sure she doesn't want the others to see her like that.

That's why I thought to come alone.

I look over the stage.

The time I spent on it was the best of my life.

All eyes were on us.

The audience laughed at our jokes and applauded until their hands were sore.

That moment was so special that I forgot all about my contest with Marlowe.

The first day she brought me here...

Olivia must have been looking at the stage with the same feeling I have now.

When I remember that night, a smile comes to my lips.

Step by step, I approach the stage.

I stand where Olivia stood during rehearsals.

A position from which you can overlook one end of the stage to the other.

And then...

From backstage, I hear the thud of something falling.
Will
Olivia? Are you there?

The backstage area is separated by a thick curtain.

I reach for the cloth and...
Spencer
Oh?
Will
You...
Spencer
You are... Shakespeare!
Will
Spencer.
Spencer
Mm? What is it?
Will
Uh, nothing.
Spencer
I saw your hermosa performance today.
Spencer
It was truly magnifico. Are you going to keep writing and exercise that creativo brain of yours? I mean, it would be a waste not to.
Will
I will. I was planning to from the beginning.
Spencer
Oh, and your dress, it was simply sublime. If you ever grow weary of being Olivia's esclavo, come to me.
Will
No, uh, thanks...
Spencer
Though you're still not as hermoso as Olivia. That said, you are quite precioso indeed.
Spencer
A precioso, shining chico. I do believe you have room to grow and spread your wings.
Will
Okay?
Spencer
Bien, muy bien.

What's bien?
Spencer
I shall come to watch you act again, buenas noches.
Will
...

Spencer walks past me and leaves the theater swiftly.
Will
What was he doing here?

After watching him leave, I go backstage.
Will
Olivia?

When I call out to her, Olivia's shoulders twitch in the dark.
Olivia
Will?

She's changed into her usual dress.

But her clothes look a bit disheveled.

Maybe she was in the middle of changing.
Will
Ah, sorry. I wasn't peeping on you or anything.
Olivia
...

Her eyes are swimming about.
Will
It's late, so I was wondering where you were.
Will
Everyone's waiting for you.
Olivia
Right...
Will
We can't celebrate without our leader, can we?

She doesn't respond.

Something's off.

I stare at her for a moment.

She turns away from me and speaks with her back to me.
Olivia
Did you see that?
Will
See what?
Olivia
...

Her gaze still wanders.
Will
I didn't see you changing clothes.
Olivia
...Right.

Then, I notice her costume scattered on the floor.
Will
...

She follows my gaze and goes to pick it up in a hurry.
Will
What's wrong? You're acting strange.

Olivia keeps her head down, refusing to look at me.
Will
Did something happen with Spencer? Did he do something to you?

Her head snaps back to me, and I see fear in her eyes.
Olivia
Why?
Will
Huh? We just passed each other on the stage.
Olivia
...Oh.

Silence falls.

An awkward, pregnant silence.
Will
What's wrong? Did something happen?
Olivia
...
Will
Olivia? What happened?
Olivia
Nothing at all.
Will
Don't lie to me. I can't do anything if you don't talk to me.
Olivia
You want to know? You're gonna make me say it?

Olivia sniggers.
Will
Huh?
Olivia
Right, you won't understand unless I spell it out, will you?
Will
What?

Olivia turns to me, clearly at her wit's end.
Olivia
I was just sharing an intimate moment with my fiance backstage. You have a problem with that?
Will
...

I look at the bundle of clothes she's holding.

It's the Lysander costume she wore on stage.
Will
Here? Just now?
Olivia
Yes, that's what I said.

Olivia answers my question without blinking.

Like she's just swatting down a fly.
Will
...
Olivia
...
Will
I see.
Olivia
What, you have something to say?
Will
No...

Olivia glares at me, still holding the costume in her arms.

At a loss, I hang my head and look down at the floor.

For a moment I picture them doing that here, but I quickly push the thought from my mind.

It has nothing to do with me. It's between the two of them.

I don't have the right to say anything.

The silence extends.
Olivia
I do it for my own benefit. No one has the right to belittle me over it.

She murmurs slowly, each word more marked than the last.

I raise my face and look at her.

Her eyes seem out of focus.
Olivia
I couldn't keep on living otherwise. I couldn't own the stage I saw for myself.
Olivia
You've no reason to find fault with my actions. I have no regrets.

Olivia says, staring into my eyes.

Silent tears trail down her face.
Will
You...
Olivia
What?
Will
...are no good at acting this role.
Olivia
...
Will
I'm not going to find fault or belittle you. If this is what you want to do, that's all there is to it.
Will
It's just as you say. If you have no regrets and are satisfied with this, I won't say a word.

She bites down on her lower lip.

The tears keep on rolling with no sign of stopping.
Will
But...
Will
It doesn't seem like that's the case.
Olivia
How would you even know such a thing?
Will
Then let me ask you this.
Will
Why are you crying?
Olivia
...

It seems like she's about to say something, but she chokes on the words.

Instead, she just bites her lip and says nothing.
Will
If you truly have no regrets...
Will
Why do you look so terribly miserable?
Olivia
Silence!

Olivia throws her costume at me and storms out onto the stage.
Olivia
*Sob*

The tears won't stop.

I ran away from him in the heat of the moment.

His steady gaze, his words of concern.

I simply can't bear it.

I can still feel Spencer in me.

It's revolting. I detest it with every fiber of my being.

I want to scratch at my body until my skin tears and I can scrub out the lingering feeling from within.

But I can't rid myself of the sensation.

I don't want to face Will like this, dirtied and sullied.

The tears keep falling down my face.

They create streaks down my cheeks and run down my neck.

Normally, I could stop at the drop of a hat.

I could conjure up a bold smile to hide behind.

But this time, I can't.

Even though I know I can't afford even one second of not being an actress in front of others.

I know this, and yet...
Olivia
...

I can't force my face muscles to make any expression.

I can't do anything but cry like a little girl.

All the faces I practiced just aren't coming to me.

I'm supposed to be a bloody actress.

I hear Will's footsteps from behind.

They grow closer, then stop.
Will
Olivia.
Olivia
Go away. I don't want to see you right now.
Will
...
Olivia
I... I'm dirty now...
Olivia
I don't want you to see me like this.
Will
Dirty how?

Will's tone is calm, gentle.
Olivia
All of me, everything. My body. My heart.

I say, closing my eyes.

I manage hold back the overwhelming sob threatening to force its way out of my throat.
Olivia
I was the one who decided that I was okay with this.
Will
...
Olivia
I would do anything I needed to be an actress, to stand on the stage!
Olivia
Sleep with my patron, and make the whole troupe my slaves.

My voice comes out like a shivering whimper.

That's what I hear as it reaches my ears.
Olivia
I have no other means, no way other than that.
Will
I see.
Olivia
Even so...

I look down at my feet.

Tears patter onto the dry wood below.

One after the other.

The tears fall like rain on the ground.
Olivia
You're the only one I didn't want to know.

I can hear Will's steady breathing from behind me.

What kind of expression is on his face as he watches me?

I am deathly afraid to look.
Olivia
I didn't want you to know. You're the last person I wanted to see me like this.
Will
Why?
Olivia
I don't know!

If we met under different circumstances...

If I were from a different background...

If I were born to a family of nobles from the beginning...

Perhaps I could have honestly told him that I wanted him to hold me, to love me.

I would have been able to express my feelings, tell him about this love for him that burns more intensely inside my chest with every passing day.

But it's too late now.

I am too late.

It's been too late since the moment I was born.

Will takes another step closer.

I can feel his faint warmth on my back.

And then...

He gently wraps his arms around me.

I can feel his cheek brushing against my hair.
Olivia
What are you doing?
Will
I don't know either.

I hear his voice near to my ear.
Olivia
Stop. Let go of me.
Will
No.
Olivia
You never think about the consequences of your actions.
Olivia
You haven't learned a thing since the day we met.
Will
I like to think I wear my heart on my sleeve.
Will
But I still won't let you go.
Olivia
Why?
Will
Because the woman I love is crying in front of me.
Olivia
Are you stupid? Did you lose your mind?

I muster the courage to snap back at him.

But I can't summon the will to move away from him.

His warm, gentle embrace...

I can't bring myself to leave it.

He's holding me tenderly, lovingly.

I can feel his resolve, his force, his scent, the beat of his heart against my back.

His everything is trying to heal me.

Now that I know how this feels, there is no way back.
Olivia
What do you mean to accomplish by doing this?
Will
I won't let you go to that man anymore.
Olivia
Impossible.
Will
Don't go.
Olivia
I can't.
Will
I will save you.
Olivia
You don't have that power, sadly.
Will
No, I do. In fact, I am the only one who can do it.
Olivia
...

Will holds me a little closer to himself.

He envelops me with more force.
Will
The only person who can make you shine on the stage...
Will
...is me. No one else in the world.
Will
And for that we only need you and me.
Will
We don't need this big theater.
Will
Even if we don't have a stage...
Will
I'll make you the actress of my stories.
Will
I will be the only man in the world to do it.
Will
I'll make you an actress.
Will
So, please...

I continue crying as I listen to his speech.

Each of his words seem to permeate my body like a sweet perfume.
Will
Don't go to that man anymore.

I shake my head limply.
Olivia
The actors of a troupe without a patron are the same as vagrants.
Olivia
That's what the whole troupe will become, and so will you.
Will
We were all tramps from the beginning. All of us but you.
Olivia
Heh, I'd like to know what Kiki and the others think about that.
Will
Don't go back to that manor again. Stay with me.
Olivia
Will, I can't just...
Will
I won't let you go until you promise.

He's holding me tightly.

When did I become this indulgent?

Since when have I been this weak a person?

Reality always disappoints.

I know that better than anyone, and yet...
Olivia
...

Instead of shaking my head, I sigh.
Olivia
Perhaps fools attract one another.

I mutter with a self-deprecating chuckle.

Will doesn't laugh.
Will
Olivia.

I...

...nod weakly.
Olivia
All right. I promise.

I place my hand over his.

His hands are bigger and stronger than I realized.
Will
Good girl.

Our steps are the only sound in the quiet city street.

I walk in front, holding Olivia's hand tight.

She stays silent, clasping my hand in return.

A stream of thoughts flow through my mind one after another.

But there is something I notice in me. A feeling I've never had before.

Back then, I couldn't protect Ed.

This time, I will protect the people I love.

I grip Olivia's hand with even more force.
Olivia
No need to crush my hand, I'm not going anywhere.
Will
Ah, sorry.
Olivia
Nervous just from holding hands? You can be quite adorable sometimes.
Will
Says the woman who was crying just now.
Olivia
Mention that in front of anyone and I'll kill you.
Will
As if I would.
Olivia
I had to make sure, since you have as much tact as a cow.
Will
That goes for you too.
Olivia
Hah, indeed.

Olivia bashes me verbally but doesn't let go of my hand.
Olivia
Maybe we should tell everyone.
Will
What do you mean?
Olivia
That we're going to lose Spencer's support.
Olivia
I may not be able to pay for the living expenses I was giving them.
Olivia
The Globe belongs to him as well.
Will
Let's decide what to do tomorrow, when we're all together.
Will
Today, everyone's waiting to enjoy a good time with you and make merry.
Olivia
Yes.
Will
I'll have to tell my father what's happening.
Will
For now, you can live with us.
Olivia
Yes, I'd like that.
Will
Do you have any belongings to bring with you?
Olivia
I have few things. Most of what I need, I keep at the theater.
Olivia
I only went to the manor to play the role of a decoration for him.
Will
I see.
Olivia
...
Will
We'll manage.
Will
Our pub isn't going out of business any time soon. The troupe will be fine.
Olivia
Yes, right.

I can feel her tightening her hand around mine.
Will
Are you nervous?
Olivia
Do you have a death wish? How dare you imply that. Don't lump me in with nervous wrecks like you.
Will
That's the spirit.

I smile at her sullen face.
Olivia
Will.
Will
Yeah?
Olivia
Thank you for accepting me.
Olivia
It means a lot.
Will
Okay, who are you you, and what did you do with Olivia?
Olivia
Oh, will you shut up!

I squeeze her hand again.

She returns it with a squeeze of her own.

Slowly, we walk side by side through the night.
Kiki
Whoa, took you long enough!
Rob
Do you enjoy making us wait?!
Will
Sorry, all! We thought it'd be good to prepare for tomorrow while we were at the theater.
Olivia
I hope no one started drinking without us.
Rob
Look at this lass! Who does she think we've been waiting for?!
Thomas
We didn't have a single drop. No one's brave enough to cross our leader.
Olivia
Ahahah, good boys. Well done.
Will
Okay, let me get us all some drinks.
Olivia
I'll help.

I pour ale into the cups, and Olivia gets the cups into people's hands.

Eventually everyone has a cup of ale, except for my father.

He's looks miffed, sitting in his corner holding a cup of water.
Olivia
Everyone, you did most magnificently today. Good work. I think it was a very good performance, but there's always room for improvement.
Olivia
We will rehearse before raising the curtains tomorrow, so don't drink too much.
Kiki
Eep!
Olivia
Kiki, you became the troupe's main draw today. Hold your head high.
Kiki
Me? The main draw?
Olivia
You were very popular too, Thomas. Brace yourself, the public still has a lot more of you to see.
Thomas
Yes, ma'am!
Olivia
We have many challenges ahead of us, but...

Olivia trails off and looks at me.
Olivia
We'll be chosen for the court performance no matter what. Isn't that right, Will?
Will
Naturally. My scripts are the best in the world.
Olivia
Well said, William Shakespeare.

A satisfied smile touches her lips as she turns back to the others.

Looking at her profile, I see the usual Olivia.

She's a great actress.
Olivia
To this fleeting moment that will stay with us forever, like a midsummer night's dream...
Olivia
Cheers, my friends.
Kiki&Thomas
Cheers!
Rob
Heheh. Boss, let's do a little toast of our own.
Father
Toasting with water would be the saddest thing.
Rob
Who cares? Will's talent is finally blossoming. No happier occasion than this.
Father
Yes, you are right indeed.

Rob raises his cup.
Rob
To the ones we lost. To Ed.
Father
To friendship everlasting.

Dad and Rob clink their cups together.

Olivia's eyes meet with mine.

She raises her cup as well.

I follow her lead and lift mine.

We share a personal toast from behind the bar.

We eat, drink, and make merry with the rest of the troupe members as the night rolls on.

When it's time to go, we see everyone off until it's just me, Olivia, Rob, and Dad left in the pub.
Father
Well then, it's about time for this old dog to hit the hay.
Father
You're not going home yet, Rob?
Rob
I'll be on my way after I finish this drink.
Father
All right. See you all on the morrow, then.
Will
Dad.
Father
How may I help you, Lord Playwright?
Will
I need to tell you something.
Father
Huh? What is it?

Dad looks up in my direction.

I let my gaze linger over the counter for a moment.
Rob
Huh? Family matter? Want me to leave so you can talk?

I exchange glances with Olivia.

She shakes her head firmly.
Olivia
You're a peddler who visits the manor frequently enough. I'm sure you'd come to know sooner or later, so it may as well be now.
Rob
Mm?
Will
All right.

I step out from behind the counter and face both Rob and my dad.
Will
I'd like Olivia to live here from now on.
Father
Huh?
Rob
Why?
Will
Err, why, you ask?
Rob
I mean, aren't you Spencer's fiancee?
Rob
Don't you have to go back to him?
Olivia
There is no engagement between us.
Olivia
External pressures and expectations made everyone assume so, and it's true that's what he wants from me, but there is nothing set in stone.
Rob
Wait, what? What do you mean?
Father
Olivia, are you truly turning down a rich man to settle down for this lousy cook?
Rob
Hahahah, you're gonna regret it later!
Will
That's not what this is about, Dad.
Olivia
I will never regret it. That, I can assure you.
Rob
Oh...

I stare at Olivia's profile in disbelief.

She gives me a small smile then turns back to my dad and Rob.

The two of them look from one to the other of us.

Olivia blows out a small sigh, and speaks.
Olivia
I was bought too.

The two of them look at her.

I also turn to her.
Will
Bought? What do you mean?
Olivia
I wasn't born in this country.
Rob
So you're from the island out west, eh?

Olivia nods.
Olivia
I was brought here, and my siblings were taken to the New World to work as slaves. I was auctioned off on account of my looks.
Olivia
A story as old as time, is it not?
Will
You...
Will
...were a slave too?
Olivia
Yes.

Rob and Dad simply look up at her in silence.
Rob
Why?
Olivia
Because of where I was born, that's all.
Olivia
What other reason do "civilized" people need to make slaves out of others?
Olivia
Ah, perhaps trying to steal a deer would have been a better reason?

Olivia says, quirking up a smile.
Will
That's an exception.
Olivia
Yes, that's right. I'll have you know that I wouldn't have failed; I never did. Failing was the difference between life and death.
Olivia
Just as people are born into noble houses on no merit of their own, people are also born as slaves through no fault of their own.
Olivia
I did what I needed to stay alive. Whatever job, no matter what it was.
Olivia
And when I had no job, I simply stole from others.
Olivia
For better of worse, I never had to kill a person, but I believe I would have done so should the situation have called for it.
Will
...

I am speechless after hearing about Olivia's life.

But at the same time, a lot of things make sense now.

Why her manner of speech is different from all the other nobles.

Why a noble like her would know how to cook and clean.

Ed and Rob picked up on all that as soon as she started helping in the pub.

Olivia was always different from the image I had of the aristocracy.

I feel like all those incongruities are coming together now.

So she wasn't born a noble.

No, even now she doesn't truly have the freedom of the ruling classes.
Olivia
When I was ripped away from my family and auctioned off, Spencer was the one who bid on me.
Father
Auctioned off? Then where does all this fiancee talk come from?
Olivia
He said he wanted to marry me. Even though I'm his slave? That man is strange, not normal at all.
Rob
Yeah, I can see that.
Father
Is that Spencer man such a strange noble?
Will
He's a deviant. I can never see any rhyme or reason to what he says or does.

Olivia nods in agreement, and so does Rob as he downs his cup of ale.
Olivia
Because of where I come from...
Olivia
My situation resembles yours, in a sense.
Rob
Yes, that island...

I hear that Catholics account for more than eighty percent of the population.
Olivia
During the Ulster rebellion 16 years ago, my siblings and I were imprisoned and sent to this country.
Olivia
Back when we were still in our own country, almost starving to death, a kind man in scarlet robes took notice and fed us from his bread.
Father
Scarlet robes?
Rob
A cardinal of the church, you mean?

A meaningful smiles crosses her face.
Olivia
We thought so at the time. We were overjoyed, thinking that believers truly extended a helping hand to others.
Olivia
But we realized as soon as we came closer—the man's mantle stank.
Will
...
Olivia
It was dyed red with blood. By the time we realized he was a slave dealer, it was already too late.
Olivia
My sister and I were sold off to different houses. They would use me as they saw fit, and I would escape, only to repeat that cycle until I got to Tenbridge.
Olivia
The day I was bought by Spencer and told I was going to be his slave, I didn't have the energy to resist my rotten fortune anymore.
Olivia
Until I was taken to a court performance by Spencer and saw the resplendent beauty of theater with my own two eyes. Until then, my world was gray, quite literally.

No one dares say a word.

Olivia continues talking.
Olivia
So, to clarify. I am not his fiancee.
Olivia
But it is true that I used that as bait to get him to become the patron of my acting troupe.
Father
...
Rob
...
Olivia
I did that to keep this troupe doing.

She falls silent, having finished her tale.
Rob
Can I ask a question? Why are you going so far for this? You're the owner of the troupe, right?
Rob
But it almost sounds as if you...

We've finally come to the heart of the matter.

Until now, we've kept the fact that she acts on stage hidden.

The idea of a woman dressing as a man is looked down upon and decried even among Catholics.

I would have liked to sidestep this topic if at all possible.

But...
Olivia
I...
Olivia
...stand on the stage, as a man.

Olivia tells them the truth, resolute and decisive.
Olivia
I think it's wrong that a woman can't act on stage. That's why my goal is to be chosen for a court performance.

Rob squints at her.
Rob
What do you mean?
Will
...

I haven't heard about this from her either.
Olivia
If we are selected and our abilities are recognized, we can become the Lord Chamberlain's Men.
Olivia
The troupe closest to the Queen's ear.
Olivia
And being near the only person with the power to change the law means we can—
Father
You are aiming to endear yourself to the theater loving Queen, then.

Olivia nods.
Rob
That is one tough battle you're fighting, lass.
Olivia
But that's what gives my life meaning.
Olivia
It's an injustice that a woman can't stand on the stage that bestows dreams and hopes onto people's lives. Why do we decide who can act or not based on something as arbitrary as gender?

Rob and dad simply stare at her in silence.
Olivia
The dazzling world of theater gave my drab life color.
Olivia
I can't even remember what the play that inspired me was about anymore. I just cried at the end, not even knowing why.
Olivia
From that moment on, I wanted to stand on the stage too. I had no choice but to take back my own life.
Olivia
That's why I desperately searched for a way to do so, and brought this troupe together.

Now she turns to me.
Olivia
And finally, I obtained the talent I needed from Will's hand.
Olivia
For me, acting in this troupe is what gives my life hope.
Rob
...
Father
I see now.

Silence fills the room.

A long, heavy silence.

I imagine a young Olivia in my mind.

Hearing her talk, I understood immediately that she has many more bitter memories locked away inside of her.

Compared to her, I certainly am a pampered, blessed boy.

I pitied myself and thought of myself as the center of the world. It was all about me and not getting what I perceived as my right.

But...

That was before I met her.
Will
Now...
Will
This troupe isn't just yours. Kiki, Thomas, and everyone else are desperate to improve.
Will
I want to do everything I can for this troupe as well.
Will
Now that I know about all the sacrifices you had to make.
Will
I need to do something about it.
Father
So you want to rescue her from her predicament and let her live with us?
Will
Yes.
Father
I see.
Rob
But didn't you just finish your first performance today?
Rob
What happens now?
Will
Well...
Will
I figured I'd cross those bridges as I come to them.
Rob
Hah! You're going off the cuff, eh?
Olivia
The Globe is Spencer's property, but even if we're kicked out tomorrow, I don't think he would find a new tenant anytime soon.
Olivia
Thankfully, our premiere was well received, and I think we'll have full seats going forward.
Olivia
Spencer may be a noble, but his rank is only that of a landed gentry. And he needs funds to prepare for his move to the New World.
Olivia
If we use the admission fees to pay him rent, I think he'll let us rent the place like a business.
Olivia
When it comes to money, that's the only matter where he actually makes sensible decisions.
Rob
He has a rather gaudy life to be part of the gentry.
Olivia
Perhaps he has both an eye for aesthetics and another one for business.
Olivia
You can take what comes out of his mouth at face value. He is no schemer, at the very least.
Rob
I see. So as someone who sells to him, that must make me a purveyor of the finest goods, yes?
Olivia
I don't know about that.
Father
So, Will, what is it that you wanted to ask me about?
Will
Huh? I wanted your permission to let Olivia live here with us for now.

My dad looks up at me while I trip over my words.

Even if there's no light in his eyes, I still feel like he can see right through me.
Will
I wanted to know if you're okay with it.
Father
So what if I were to say no? You'd give up?
Will
...No.
Father
After listening to her story, I don't think Olivia's a woman who you can approach without having a made up mind and an iron will.
Father
Isn't that right, Rob?
Rob
Well, she is a tough woman, that's for sure.
Olivia
This is not about my personality, is it?

Olivia interjects, but my dad keeps his eyes on me.
Father
Son, you won't take Olivia from that noble by fretting over every single thing.
Father
This isn't like stealing a deer.
Olivia
Heheh. You may be right, good sir.
Will
All right.

Dad's absolutely right.

I take a deep breath.
Will
Olivia will be living in our house from now on. I'm sorry if that's a bother for you, but I hope you'll be understanding.
Father
Heard you loud a clear.
Rob
Ah, to be young.

I turn to Olivia.
Will
You can sleep in my room today. I'll sleep on the floor.

Olivia nods in response.
Will
I will go and negotiate with Spencer, so...
Will
Tell me the costs we'll incur to keep the troupe going and our projected income.
Will
If we need new works to keep afloat, I'll write as much as we need.
Olivia
But I should be the one to talk to him.

I hold up my hand in front of her.
Will
This is my job. You don't need to see that man ever again.
Olivia
...
Rob
Boss, our little lad's done some growing up, eh?
Father
Mhm.
Rob
Shall we toast to that?
Father
With water once more, I suppose.
Rob
Who cares about what's in the cup? Come on now.
Father
Yeah, you're right.
Olivia
We have some space on the first floor, don't you think? We could pack more people in there if we get more seats.
Olivia
We sold out of meals today, so let's prepare more for tomorrow. If we make as much as we can, we could earn about thirty percent more, right?
Will
Is that all of the proceeds?
Olivia
Yes.
Will
How about the expenses?
Olivia
I give the troupe members a weekly salary. This is the minimum we need.

Olivia writes down the amount she's giving each person.
Will
Hey, why didn't I ever get money like this?
Olivia
I pay you in kind, don't I? How much do you think I contribute to this pub's sales? You bold-faced, greedy fox.
Will
I know, I'm just kidding.
Will
How much should we estimate for the Globe's rent?
Olivia
Mm, for a theater that size...

Olivia writes down the amount.
Will
Are you serious?
Olivia
The place can hold two hundred times the capacity of this pub. It's just how it is.
Olivia
And...

Olivia writes another amount of money below that.
Will
What's that?
Olivia
Payment to get out of bondage. Slaves have to pay their owners for their freedom.
Will
Owner...
Olivia
...

Her mouth becomes a hard line, and she hangs her head.
Will
Okay, I'll pay. I'll negotiate it so we can pay in installments.

We finish calculating all the expenses.

And considering our current admission fees...
Will
We need a full house every day, huh?
Olivia
Yes, we do.
Will
No holidays for us, it seems.
Olivia
That was the plan from the start, but what I'm worried about is audience fatigue setting in.
Olivia
We may have the play down, but it's still only one play.
Olivia
It may be difficult to keep pulling in an audience every day for a whole month with just the one.
Will
Let's begin rehearsing the tragedy's first draft as as soon as we can. How much time do you want to spend rehearsing Midsummer Night's Dream before the performance tomorrow?
Olivia
Hmm. I'd like to take about an hour for it, but I don't think we'll need as much time after that.
Will
Rather than keep tweaking a work to perfection, I want to get the audience excited and give them something new.
Olivia
But I really want at least an hour for it tomorrow. We can rehearse the new play as much as you want after that.
Will
How much time do you think it'll take to have Hamlet in a good place? All five acts, I mean.
Olivia
To be honest, it should take about a month. But we obviously don't have that much time.
Will
Two weeks. No, one.
Olivia
Ten days. Let's spend the first five days on each act, and the other five running through the whole thing each day.
Olivia
We'll be rushing, but we hardly have a choice.
Will
But we could maybe announce we're presenting a new play on the seventh day, and premiere it on the eighth if we feel the troupe is ready for it.
Olivia
That is, if we strike upon a miracle every single day and everything goes well. We shouldn't try to push it any sooner than ten days.
Olivia
Remember, we're gonna be practicing while also performing every single day.
Will
...Right.

Ten days from now, we'll add Hamlet to our repertoire.
Will
Even if we have two plays to perform, we can't have two showings every day, can we?
Olivia
Not likely. It would be night by the time we started the second showing.
Will
How about we start at noon?
Olivia
Then we'll be unable to practice new plays.
Will
Mmh...
Olivia
And if we have to perform five acts every single day, it'll wear out the actors' focus.
Olivia
You realized that today too, didn't you?
Will
So, for the next ten days, we'll continue with A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Will
And then we premiere Hamlet. Do we want to add another one before the court selection?
Olivia
We'll need a new play by then.
Olivia
So after than tenth day, we need to start rehearsing a new play in the mornings while performing Hamlet in the evenings.
Olivia
Once we have Hamlet in our repertoire, we could alternate between it and Midsummer Night's Dream.
Olivia
If we can get a new play out every ten days, we'll definitely get the audience to come back to the theater every ten days too, at the very least.
Will
I see. In that case...
Will
We'll be able to pay.

A smile touches her lips.
Olivia
Can you write a new play after this?
Will
I will. I must.
Olivia
Yes.

Silence falls over the room.

Olivia's looking out at the moon outside the window.

The shine of the moonlight makes her porcelain skin glow with an almost magical sheen.

I feel something inside my chest swell as I watch her.

Staying here alone with her isn't good for my sanity.

I feel like some kind of beast inside me is struggling to break loose.

I get up and shake my head.
Olivia
What's wrong?
Will
I'll go talk to Spencer.
Olivia
Right now?
Will
Today is the last day this troupe has a patron.
Will
If we don't do things properly, nothing will change.
Will
I'll be back.
Olivia
You're going alone?
Will
Yes.
Will
Spencer and I have to reach a settlement regarding your situation.

Her expression darkens.
Olivia
Okay.
Will
It'll be fine.
Olivia
I'll wait up for you.

I nod, take one last look at the balance figures, and leave the room.

The huge manor looms over me as I stand in the vast patch of land that belongs to the estate.

I take a deep breath as I look over its gigantic, opulent presence.

I need to face Spencer.

I look back on our two previous encounters.

Has he ever really listened to anything I said? It always feels like he's talking at me, instead of to me.

Somehow, it doesn't even feel like we're speaking the same language.

But I must do this.

For Olivia.

After bracing myself and taking a deep breath, I knock on the door.

An elderly butler opens the door, and I inform him that I've come to speak to Spencer about Olivia.

After giving me a glance over, he ushers me inside.

This is the hall I was brought to when I tried to steal the deer.

The butler seems to remember me.

Which means he remembers that day when I became Olivia's slave.

The butler goes up a big flight of stairs and knocks on one of the many doors.

He says something to the person behind the door, then comes down the stairs again.

He informs me that Spencer will be with me shortly, then wanders off somewhere.

My palms are sweaty.

After a while, the door the butler knocked on opens, and Spencer comes out of the room.

He comes down the stairs with relaxed, light steps.
Spencer
Hi, chico.
Will
Good evening.
Spencer
I am told you wish to talk about my little Olive? What is it? Did you get fed up of being her esclavo?
Will
No.
Will
From today, Olivia is no longer your slave.
Spencer
Hmm?
Will
If you want money to settle this, I'll pay it. I also want to rent the Globe theater.
Will
Since Olivia won't be your slave anymore, it wouldn't make sense for you to patron the troupe. That's why I've come to rent it.
Spencer
You mean to pay for her, you mean? You are Olivia's esclavo, are you not?
Spencer
What is the meaning of this? Are you making an esclava out of her now?

I shake my head.
Will
Olivia will be a free woman from now on. She won't be anyone's property anymore.
Spencer
Hmm, so you will foot the costo for that?
Spencer
There is no chica as beautiful as Olive. She's quite expensive.
Will
State your price.
Spencer
Hm...

The price Spencer tells me is the exact amount Olivia wrote down.

Spencer's eyes widen in surprise as I nod and accept the offer.
Will
I'll pay. I just need to pay in instalments.
Spencer
Instalments?
Will
I'll pay for it together with the Globe's monthly rent. You can attach an interest rate to the payments if you want.
Will
You can't really rent that big theater to anyone but people making plays, can you?
Spencer
You are correcto. Yes, I would not mind renting it to you, Shakespeare.
Spencer
But can you pay? You're not coming to me without a plan, right?
Will
The premiere of the play I wrote for the troupe was today. We filled the whole theater and the sales were good.
Spencer
Felicitaciones. Good for you.
Will
I will write two more plays this month. If we keep the seats full and attract the audience back every ten days, we'll be able to pay you.
Spencer
And after that?
Will
Our troupe...
Will
...will be selected for the court performance. After that we'll have a new patron and pay off the remainder of our debts.
Spencer
I see. You aim for the Lord Chamberlain to shoulder the cost.

Spencer nods to himself.
Spencer
Good, chicos must be ambitious. I don't dislike your enthusiasm.
Spencer
I find such lofty aspirations very calientes indeed in people with the capacity. As for you...

Spencer looks me up and down slowly, sizing me up.
Spencer
Yes, you are a chico with the talent to meet your goals. I think you will achieve it.
Will
...Thanks.
Spencer
Okay, we have a trato. Do with Olive as you please. She is tuya now.
Will
What?
Spencer
Huh? Isn't that what you came here for?
Will
Yeah, but...
Will
I heard that you asked Olivia to marry you, so...

Spencer looks genuinely curious about my confusion.
Will
You would let go of her that easily?
Spencer
No problema. There's no problem at all. Tell Olive she is free to come back to me if she ever needs help.
Spencer
She can become my esclava once again whenever she likes. I look after my esclavos, that's my personal policy.
Will
She's not a slave.
Spencer
Olive became my esclava out of her own volition. It is her choice, not to be made by you.
Will
...
Spencer
But I do not dislike change. Me gusta, to be honest.
Spencer
Well, do try your best, playwright. Let us hope it goes well for you.
Will
...
Spencer
And one more thing. I will need a guarantee in the case your plan doesn't go, well, as planned.
Will
What?
Spencer
A garantia. Collateral.
Will
What do you want?
Spencer
You shall become my esclavo. Oh, how I would love for you to wear that Hermia costume for me at night.
Will
...
Spencer
Not a bad deal, if I do say so myself.
Will
...All right.
Spencer
*Shudder* Hoooh! Yes, what a great deal. Yes, me encanta!
Will
...Good for you.
Spencer
So your new obra will be unveiled in ten days, yes? May I go see it?
Will
Do as you like.
Will
I don't have the luxury of choosing my clients.
Spencer
Ah, how lindo. That open hostility, that fuego in your soul. That erect determination, haah...
Spencer
I can't wait to see the fruits of your trabajo. Would you like to stay the night? You are always welcome in this manor of mine with open arms, and legs.
Will
No, thank you. Olivia's waiting for me.
Spencer
You and Olive?! Ah, what a match made in los cielos! Oh, I do want to see... May I?
Will
No. See you at the theatre. And don't come near the stage.
Spencer
Ah, the tragedy, it is so very triste. Oh no!

I leave the manor with Spencer's moans echoing behind me.
Will
...

The talks went as well as they could have gone.

I'm stunned at how smoothly it went, actually.

Now all I have to do is write.

But...

The problem is I have no material.

To be honest, I have nothing in my head left that could surpass Hamlet.

As I wrote the play, I felt the boundary between Hamlet and myself crumble.

If I hadn't written it down, perhaps I would have ended up consumed up by my own vengeful thoughts.

The act of writing itself can be a form of salvation for the writer.

Now that I've finished writing it, I can look back and realize that's the truth.

That's why I'm able to keep myself in check as I work to improve the troupe so people can see and hear what I have to say.

All of my hatred for Marlowe...

The sense of loss and impotence...

I mixed it all together in my internal melting pot, and Hamlet came out.

If I want to paint it in a positive light, I could say that I've cleaned out all of those emotions.

But if I want to be negative, I would say that I'm completely empty and out of ideas.

I've come to understand the important points and beats a play must hit upon.

And now I'm familiar with the movements of the actors bringing these characters to life on stage.

I feel that my technique has improved significantly.

I am, by all means, a better writer now than I was a month ago.

Yet now I wonder, what should I even write?

What can I write?

What would make Olivia happy?
Olivia
Will!

As soon as I open the door, Olivia leaps out of the bed and onto me.

I can see the worry clear as day in her eyes.

I smile reassuringly at her.
Will
It's fine. Spencer accepted our conditions.
Will
All we have to do is pay the money we promised.
Will
It'll be all right. We just have to focus on the plays.

Olivia heaves a sigh of relief.
Olivia
I never thought this day would ever come.
Olivia
I'm so thankful that you tried to steal a deer that night.
Will
I guess we can thank the deer indirectly.

Olivia smiles, and so do I.

Gazing into her face from up close like this, I feel full of happiness.

But I feel tense at the same time.

This is naught but the starting point.
Will
We're just getting started. We won't achieve true freedom without putting in the work.

Olivia nods.
Will
It'll become much easier if—when we're selected for the court performance.
Will
I don't how much the Lily Theater makes, but I don't think any other troupe is raising that much money.
Will
We have work to do.
Olivia
Yes, but...
Olivia
When I'm with you, I feel like we can do anything.

Olivia says, putting a hand to my cheek.

I put my hand over hers and hold it there.
Olivia
Will...
Will
I'll write.

Her eyes go wide for a moment.
Olivia
Now?

I nod in response.
Olivia
Have you decided what the next theme will be?
Will
No, actually.
Will
But I feel like I need to be at my desk right now. I don't think I'll be able to sleep for a while yet.
Olivia
We have a performance tomorrow, remember?
Will
I know. I'll catch a few winks.
Will
You should go to bed though. You're the head of this troupe. You need your sleep.
Olivia
But...
Will
I'll be fine, I'm used to this.
Olivia
...
Will
I need to write something that can bring tears to the eye of our discerning leader. It's not an easy job.
Olivia
You're the best boy.

Olivia whispers into my ear and plants a kiss on my forehead.
Olivia
You can write it, I'm certain.

I sit at my desk, and Olivia watches me for a while.

I barely move my quill.

I'm just sitting there, staring at a blank sheet of parchment.

I hear Olivia turn over on the bed a few times and sneak a glance over at her.

She's sleeping soundly.

I can hear her little sighs.

Even while asleep...

...she's as lovely as ever.

I can't help feeling that I'm not man enough to be worth the love of such a magnificent person.

I just learned of her origins, but she's still spent half of her life among nobility.

Even if she made a wrong turn, she would never end up in a run down pub like this one.

Suddenly, I feel terribly distant from her.

Even though we're in the same room.

She's so near, yet seemingly so far out of reach.

I realize that I've always had this feeling in my heart, ever since the day we met.

Although I'm right beside her, I can't quite reach her.
Will
...

How can I make that into a play?

How can I express this mental wall I feel between us?

I need to turn this into something symbolic, something everyone can sympathize with.

First of all...

Perhaps I should start with the people we saw one another as when we first met.

A love between a young bartender and a beautiful noblewoman.

When the young man sneaks into the mansion, he falls in love with the woman at first sight.

He approaches the woman, as if feeling the pull of destiny itself.

And the two speak of love.
Will
...

I blush fiercely when I read over what I wrote in the heat of the moment.

It's too obvious and frank.

This is a personal poem meant for the two of us.

It's too embarrassing to even reread it.

I may have gotten a little too sentimental.

I crumple the piece of manuscript and throw it away.

It's no good. There is no way I can surpass Hamlet with such a simple story.

Think, Will, think.

I look at my shelves, recall Rob's rumors, and search through my old notes, but nothing catches my eye.

When dawn starts to break, I go down to the pub and take a short nap.
