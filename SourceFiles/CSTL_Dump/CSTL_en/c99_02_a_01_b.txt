I heard of a place called a 'pub' in the dream. What was that about?
Izumo
The people of old had a tradition of gathering and eating together outside of their homes.
Izumo
At the time, a system of 'currency' was in circulation, and people indirectly exchanged this currency for goods and services.

I feel my eyes widen in incredulous surprise.
Kaito
Why go through so much trouble?
Izumo
The population at that time was much larger than it is now. Rather than bartering, indirect exchange through paper currency was more convenient.
Izumo
A pub was a place where you could exchange currency mainly for alcoholic beverages and light meals.
Kaito
And alcohol was available to any adult?

She nods.
Izumo
If they were older than twenty years old, give or take depending on the region of the world.
Kaito
Pretty different from now, then.
Izumo
The drinking age was only lowered after we returned to the current barter economy.
Kaito
I see.
