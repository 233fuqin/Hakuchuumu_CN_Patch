Is it true that women weren't allowed to act on stage?
Izumo
Yes. Back then, it was forbidden for woman to perform. It seems that, back then, female roles were performed by young males before their voices broke.
Izumo
In the same vein, women that dressed as men were considered abhorrent, and the act was branded as taboo.

Although progress was slower in some countries, it was not until the nineteenth century that women generally started assuming a more leading role in society.

Too much time, if you ask me...
