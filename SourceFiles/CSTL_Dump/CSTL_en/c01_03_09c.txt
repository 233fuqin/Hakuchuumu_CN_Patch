...I wanted you to read it too.

Without even thinking, I mutter at nothing.

The words trickle off my lips, destined to never reach anyone's ears.

I was young.

And so was she.

Back then, we took our lives for granted.

When did it become so difficult and painful?

We used to say what we meant.

We were vulnerable in front of each other.

Once upon a time, we were a real couple.

With a heavy sigh, I sink into the couch.

I turn my face up to the ceiling and cover my eyes with my right hand.

Tears slowly make their way down my face, rolling down my cheeks one after the other.

I've fallen the lowest a person can go.

I fall back on the sofa, nothing but a dirty, shameful mess.

I'm so pathetic and disgusting that I make myself laugh.

I wanted to be someone.

Like Hatano Shuho was.

Someone who would have recognition.

I didn't want to become this pathetic mess.

At some point, I break into weak sobbing.

I weep like a damn child.

What's worse, Rin's image is still burned in my mind.

Perhaps for good, I realize.

...I should have never written a single word, let alone a novel.

From the bottom of my heart, I wish I hadn't.
