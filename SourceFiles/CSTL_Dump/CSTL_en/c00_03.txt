Kaito
...

My vision clears, and I find myself face to face with myself once more.
Kaito
So it's over?
Kaito (Hologram)
No, that was just the beginning. You still have a lot of time to experience, now that you have experienced the awakening signal.
Kaito
I see.
Kaito (Hologram)
We were pretty innocent back then, huh? Both of us.
Kaito
I wouldn't have imagined Yonagi was ever such a bright and lively girl.
Kaito (Hologram)
Yes. She was bright and true. She always knew what true happiness really was, even if it took me a little time to figure that out.
Kaito (Hologram)
On the other hand, I was a pretty wimpy kid.
Kaito (Hologram)
Once we started living together, we looked out for each other. All the other lowsiders watched over us.
Kaito (Hologram)
Looking back on it, I think we were lucky to have such a supportive community behind us.
Kaito (Hologram)
I was just too young to realize it back then.
Kaito (Hologram)
But as you can imagine, we grew up.
Kaito (Hologram)
We made it to adulthood, together.
Kaito
*Huff*! *Huff*!

Finally!

It's the day I—

No, the day we've been waiting for all these years.

I run along the trail through the cornfields.

I wonder how many times I've walked down this path during all these years.

They looked so tall back when I was a kid, but now they're about eye level.

And yet I run down this road the same way I always have.

I dash like I did when I was a kid, pure joy fueling my steps.

The house comes into view at the end of the long trail.

Our house.

Yonagi is waiting for me in there.

I can't wait for her to hear the good news so we can celebrate.
Kaito
Yonagi!
Yonagi
Kaito, welcome back! What happened to you? Were you running?
Kaito
It's been decided!
Yonagi
Hm?
Kaito
I'm going to start working in Professor Asuma's lab! I'll be an associate researcher!
Yonagi
*Gasp*!

Yonagi gasps, her eyes widening in surprise.

Seeing the exact reaction I was expecting brings a huge smile to my face.
Yonagi
You did it! Congrats!
Kaito
It's all thanks to you. We need to celebrate!
Yonagi
You bet we will! Let's make something special today! Izumo deserves a rest anyway!

I put my bag down and sit at the table.
Izumo
Here.

Izumo quickly places a bowl of boiled flakes on the table.

It's the same dish Izumo makes for us every day.

My gaze meets Yonagi's, and we can't help but smile.

It's been more than ten years since Mom passed away and we started living together.

I started attending college, and now I've been selected as a research student candidate. Thankfully, I was assigned to my first choice of workplace, Professor Asuma's lab.
Kaito
The current big idea is developing new drugs for oral intake, but I don't believe that research will go anywhere.
Kaito
Or rather... It excludes too many.
Kaito
They'll never be able to make a drug that's 100% safe for everyone. And right now, only the young and healthy will be able to experience life on the surface.
Kaito
Professor Asuma's solution can help a lot more people.

Yonagi smiles and nods along with my rapid explanation.
Kaito
We're one step away from becoming midsiders. We won't have to work down here anymore.
Yonagi
Midsiders, huh?
Kaito
...

Yonagi's gaze wanders down to the table as she murmurs.
Kaito
What?
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
Aren't you happy?
Yonagi
I'm really happy you're achieving your dream!
Yonagi
But I really like our home here.

Her gaze drifts to the bed by the window.

The sunset light seeping through the window gives the empty bed an orange hue.

I know what she must be imagining right now.
Kaito
...I love this house too. We have a lot of memories here. But we have to move forward.
Kaito
We need to live.
Yonagi
Yeah, I know.
Kaito
If we go to the middle side, we won't have to work every day. You can use the time to write your novel.
Yonagi
I'm happy working during the day then having dinner together like this. I mean, you'll still be working during the day as a researcher, right?
Kaito
Yeah, but...
Yonagi
Writing is more of a hobby for me, so I'm happy doing it in my free time. I'm fine with us both working, and then spending our evenings together.

She smiles fondly at me.
Kaito
But...
Yonagi
But I'm really happy for you! You can't even imagine!
Yonagi
You've always wanted to work with Professor Asuma, right?
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
I haven't seen him in so long. Has he been well?
Kaito
Yeah. He pretty much looks the same as back when we were at school.

We started living together right after Mom passed away.

Me, Yonagi, and Izumo.

Before being dumped like trash, Izumo had her data wiped and some of her functions disabled.

It seems like the topsiders don't like their androids being reused, so they intentionally ruin their functionality before throwing them away.

It took a long time to repair the damage they had done to her.

I still haven't managed to fix her completely, either.

The fact that she cooks the exact same thing every day must mean there are still some things not quite sorted out inside of her.
Kaito
Thanks for the meal.

When I finish my meal and put the spoon down, Izumo begins to clean the table.
Yonagi
Thanks, Izumo. It was delicious.
Izumo
Glad to hear.

There's only room for one table in our tiny house.

At each mealtime, I have to shelve my terminals and research materials, then get them back out after we're done.

I've always wanted the space for at least one more desk.

Moving to the middle side would solve all that.

Just the thought of it makes my heart leap.

Yonagi places several books on the table along with a hardcover notebook and a pen, and sits across from me.

Every night she writes her stories down in that thick notebook.

I believe she's writing a story about William Shakespeare right now.

She's always liked his stories, ever since we were kids.

It's hard to believe that even after humanity fled underground, we're still reading something some Western guy wrote eight centuries ago.

I doubt Shakespeare himself could have even imagined such a thing back in his time.

After dinner, we each do our own thing until bedtime.

I continue my research while Yonagi reads and writes.

It's a quiet, joyful time.

There's nothing better than spending our time together in the same space as we work on our own different projects.

It's a habit we fell into soon after we started living together.
Yonagi
I wonder what kind of person he was...

About a hour and a half into her reading, Yonagi murmurs to herself, seemingly in deep thought.
Kaito
Shakespeare?
Yonagi
Yeah.
Kaito
Good question.
Yonagi
I imagine he was popular with the ladies.
Kaito
What makes you say that?
Yonagi
He captures the woman's heart so well! It's kind of, like, poethic!
Kaito
Poethic.
Yonagi
He writes about so many different things. It's honestly kind of intimidating.
Kaito
Really? How so?
Yonagi
It feels almost like one human couldn't possibly have written this. Like it has to be the work of many people or something.
Kaito
Maybe he just had a good memory like me.

There's an unnatural silence after that. I look up from my research.
Yonagi
Oh, I see! So he was able to write about so many things because he remembered the stories of the people in his life so well?
Kaito
Uh, it's not like I knew the guy.
Yonagi
No one does. The records of his time are pretty vague. Though that does have its upsides.
Kaito
Really?

Yonagi nods and raises a finger to her chin.
Kaito
What do you mean?
Yonagi
It gives me some creative freedom to... embellish the details a little. Or a lot.
Kaito
I see. So if you were to seriously argue that Galileo Galilei or Isaac Newton were actually women, nobody could tell you that you were wrong.
Yonagi
Maybe so!
Kaito
That does sound like an interesting story.
Yonagi
So if Shakespeare was the kind of guy who never forgets a story once he hears it...
Kaito
Then wouldn't he need to be in a position where he talks with lots of different people?
Yonagi
So like a teacher or something?
Kaito
That would probably be too limiting.
Kaito
Professors may talk to many people, but they're usually younger, and the age range is limited.
Yonagi
It sounds like I need to do some research on old England.
Kaito
That sounds like a plan.
Yonagi
You're starting work at the institute tomorrow, right? Maybe I can swing by the library when I'm done with work tomorrow. It's been a while since I last visited.
Kaito
Sounds good. Let's meet up there.
Yonagi
Yeah! We haven't been to the library together in forever.

She turns back to the book in her hand, looking pleased.
Yonagi
...Wanna do it today?
Kaito
Mhm.
Yonagi
Okay.

Yonagi closes the book and holds out her hand.

Mom's looking out the window.

It's her.

I try calling out, but sadly...
Kaito
...

No sound comes out of my mouth.

She just keeps looking out the window.

Her chest slowly moves up and down in time with her breathing.
Yonagi
No luck?
Kaito
...

I shake my head.
Yonagi
Hmm...
Kaito
No dice, huh?

Yonagi has the power to conjure up and share images with others.

I started calling the world she creates the "dreamscape."

Mom started appearing in it shortly after we started living together.

I believe it might have something to do with the first time when Yonagi and I shared strong emotions.

It was the first time anyone else had appeared in her dreamscape.

Before that, all she could show was her own memories and the characters she'd created.

But...

Despite my mom being right there, we can't communicate.

I'm merely a spectator in the space Yonagi creates.

I'm still searching for a way to actually interact with her dreamscape.

I feel frustration at being unable to reach out to Mom when she's right in front of me.

But it only serves to fuel my desire to study and find a solution.
Kaito
Izumo, could you show our brain waves?
Izumo
I will begin monitoring them.
Kaito
...

I compare our brain waves after entering the dreamscape.
Yonagi
How can we make it so you can talk in there?
Kaito
I really don't know. It's not like there are any precedents for this.
Kaito
And I don't have the power to project mental images like you do.
Yonagi
Mhm, mhm.
Kaito
I think if we're able to reproduce a faux dreamscape, and maybe convey my thoughts to you in real time, it could work.
Kaito
Right now, my perception of myself talking isn't being received by your mind at all.
Kaito
I think that's why I can't interact with your dreamscape.
Kaito
The communication only goes one way.
Yonagi
Hmm. So what do we do?
Kaito
Synchronize something we both have.
Kaito
Like our brainwaves, maybe. For example, when you have a fun conversation with someone close to you, the frequency and amplitude of your brainwaves start to synchronize.
Yonagi
Whoa!
Kaito
But I still don't have any way to transmit them to you...
Yonagi
Man, this whole science thing sure is tough, huh?
Kaito
Okay!

I pack my stuff into the bag I've been using since I was a kid, and hang it over my shoulder.
Kaito
I'm ready.
Yonagi
Right! I'll come to the institute after I'm done with work, okay?

I nod in response.
Kaito
Have a good day.
Yonagi
I'll try! Do your best, my junior researcher!

She sees me off with a bashful smile on her face.

She does this every morning, without fail.

And I remember each and every one of her smiles.

It wasn't until I started living with Yonagi that my inability to forget things began to seem like not such a bad thing after all.

I go up the elevator to the middle side and head to the institute.

I find myself staring at the researchers' living quarters located behind the main building.

Anyone who becomes a full researcher gets to live there, and can commute to work in just minutes.

My pace slows as I imagine myself walking to work from one of those buildings.

I wouldn't have to clean dirt off my shoes every day.

No more worrying about the cornfield sprinkler schedule whenever we want to go out.

I could give Yonagi a better life. We could be together in one of those big houses.

As I daydream, I notice a familiar face walking along from the living area to the square.
Iruma
Morning, Kaito.
Kaito
Good morning.
Iruma
And so we meet on the very first day of our new life as researchers. I can't help but wonder if it's fate that's brought us together this fine morning.
Kaito
Maybe it has to do with the fact we're both going to the same place.

He catches up to me and we walk together to the institute.

I first met Iruma in an engineering course for research candidates.

He's a born midsider and his father is a researcher as well. He's always been pretty friendly, though.

While all the other midsider research candidates held me in clear contempt for being a lowsider, Iruma was the only one to speak to me like a human being.

I remember one of the first things he said to me after I explained my situation: "Whoa, how did you manage to study with all the work you lowsiders have to do? You must be a genius."

It was kind of a rude thing to say, but I could tell he wasn't trying to be mean at all.

He wasn't trying to make fun of me for being a lowsider. He was genuinely impressed by the fact that I'd managed to accomplish something in such difficult circumstances.

Ever since then, he’s been the only person I could call my friend in the workplace.
Iruma
You got assigned to Asuma's lab, right?
Kaito
And you're with Kano, yeah?

I heard that the lab Iruma applied for got the most applications this year.

That'd be Kano lab. They're at the forefront of the study of drugs that can improve UV ray resistance, and that's the subject of research that's more predominant in the institute right now.
Iruma
What's Professor Asuma researching, even?
Kaito
The virtual space, same as he's always done. That's why I chose him.
Iruma
Oh, I remember that. I didn't know there were labs still looking into that.
Kaito
It's just him. That's why I didn't have much choice.
Iruma
So you care about what you research, huh? I guess when you're valedictorian you start to care about that stuff.
Kaito
You don't care about what you work on?
Iruma
You know I'm just killing time with this whole thing. I just picked the one that would let me socialize with other people the most. It has a lot of people working on it.
Kaito
Heh, always the same, aren't you?

The walls and floors are all white and uniform.

This place has always doubled as both the city's research facility and its educational institution.

Until just yesterday, I was a student here.

But starting today, I stand here as a researcher.

...A junior one, but my job is the same.

I stop in front of the door to Asuma's lab and take a deep breath.
Kaito
...You're ready.

When I take a step forward, the door slides open automatically, and I see Professor Asuma sitting at a desk in the back of the room.

The light seeping through the blinds illuminates no one but him in the lonely lab.
Kaito
Good morning.
Asuma
Hm? Oh...
Kaito
I've been assigned to your lab as a junior researcher.
Asuma
Ah, I see. That's today, is it?
Kaito
Yes.

He directs a jovial smile at me.

Then he swivels on his chair to face me.
Asuma
As you might imagine, not many junior researchers want to be assigned here. It's been a while since we had a newcomer.

I notice a hint of self-derision in his dry chuckle.

I decide not to say anything for now.
Asuma
Which brings me to my question. Why choose this lab?

He looks up at me, and I can feel the curiosity in his gaze.

I slowly take a breath before answering.

This is something I've wanted to tell him for years.

I feel like I've been waiting for this day ever since I first heard of his work.
Kaito
Your vision resonates with me, Professor.
Asuma
My vision?

I nod decisively.

He stays seated, his gaze urging me to elaborate further.
Kaito
Humanity shares a common goal in migration to the surface, but the challenges it entails are far too complex.
Kaito
The primary issue is the problem of ensuring safety against exposure to UV rays.
Kaito
One approach is to prevent contact with the UV rays themselves, while others propose increasing the body's resistance to them.
Kaito
If humanity migrates back to the surface, we'll be spreading out over a much wider area. Increasing the body's resistance is the only option.
Asuma
I see. You're absolutely right. And right now, they're working on oral medicine that can do just that.
Asuma
They're attempting to remedy the effects of paraglucose on our physiology, and get us to a state where we can walk on the surface again.
Asuma
Should it succeed, no external equipment such as the ozone lens will be necessary. It solves the problem at its very core.
Asuma
Wouldn't you have preferred to work on something like that?
Kaito
Even if they were to succeed...
Kaito
The second issue is the suitability of the environment on the surface.
Kaito
We don't know what the surface is like right now. Even if it's habitable, there's still the problem of deciding who lives where, and how you're even going to decide who makes those decisions.

The professor gives me a level stare.

I decide to keep going with my explanation.
Kaito
What I mean to say is that a full-scale migration to the surface will take a huge amount of time. Three decades at the least, or even more.
Kaito
Life in the underground is too harsh to endure for that long.
Kaito
In particular... for the people in the low side.

He raises one eyebrow upwards at that remark.
Asuma
You...
Kaito
I'm a lowsider.
Asuma
I see.

I nod in response.
Asuma
Sorry for interrupting. Please continue.
Kaito
But with your virtual space migration model...
Kaito
We could live on the surface virtually while we waited for the migration to take place in real life.
Kaito
It would only have to be temporary. But I believe having a temporary respite until a real solution is reached would be well worth it.
Asuma
But you don't believe the virtual space would be that real solution.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Feel free to speak your mind.
Kaito
Not right now, no.
Kaito
But I want to make a difference that I can see while I'm still alive.
Kaito
I want to know that I changed things.
Asuma
...
Kaito
I don't want to be just a gear in some grand plan that will span across generations. I want to see change happen in this world.
Kaito
While I still draw breath.
Asuma
Your youthful enthusiasm is commendable.

He lets out a small chuckle.

I don't detect any negativity or maliciousness in his tone.
Asuma
And your name is...

The professor glances down at his desk and pulls a piece of paper out of the pile.
Asuma
Aha, Kaito. I see.

I nod once more.
Asuma
Well, you've made your point most eloquently. I'm sure that, after all the thought you've put into it, you are aware of the state of this lab.

I'm nodding a whole lot today.
Asuma
Research these days is trending towards developing UV protective measures. Sixty percent of the laboratories in this facility are working towards that goal.
Asuma
Most of the research is aimed at producing oral intake tablets that could temporarily alter our physiology to be closer to that of the old humans.
Asuma
The majority of people and resources are being used to that end.
Asuma
Honestly, there are not many, other than myself, who are interested in my research.
Asuma
Despite all that, you want to work here with me, do you?
Kaito
Yes.
Asuma
Follow me. I'll give you a rundown of where we're currently at.

He gets up from his chair and strides to the back of the lab.
Asuma
In short, my design currently has an essential flaw. For the moment, anyway.
Kaito
It does?

He nods.
Asuma
Have you ever entered a virtual space?
Kaito
...No.

No one knows about Yonagi's power but us.

I can't tell anyone about it.

I don't even know if Yonagi's dreamscape could be called a virtual space.

So it's not like I'm lying.
Asuma
This is not cutting-edge technology by any means. In fact, what I'm doing is digging up obsolete technology from the old world.
Asuma
This technology was popular on the surface, once. But that was a century ago.
Kaito
Obsolete? You mean the technology that simulates the virtual space?
Asuma
Well, seeing is believing. Give it a whirl.

The professor motions for me to sit down in a capsule-like chair then fishes a small orange case from his chest pocket. He produces a pill from it and presents it to me.
Asuma
This is drug to artificially induce REM sleep. Nothing harmful for you, just a slightly more potent sleeping pill.
Asuma
Its effect is immediate and its duration short. You can suck it or chew it, whichever you prefer.

I take the pill from his outstretched palm.

Then I pop it into my mouth and feel it melt across my tongue.
Kaito
It's... sweet.
Asuma
Now lean back in the chair and close your eyes.

I do as instructed, and...
Kaito
Whoa...
Asuma
This is a simulation of Kanagawa prefecture in the year 2016. Look around. You can even enter the building.
Kaito
...

I head towards the curious building in front of me.
Kaito
Where are you?
Asuma
I'm still in the lab. I'm monitoring the sensory information in your thalamus from out here.
Asuma
You should be able to move around normally.
Kaito
You're right.

I can even speak.

It feels similar to Yonagi's dreamscape.
Kaito
What is this place?
Asuma
An old educational facility from that time. Quite extravagant, is it not?
Kaito
Yeah.

The facility is furnished with a massive library, a hall, and countless classrooms.

It's humongous compared to my idea of a place of education.
Asuma
How did you like that short excursion to the surface?
Kaito
It was... incredible.
Asuma
Let's go back. I'll brew you some coffee.
Kaito
Coffee?

The professor grinds some kind of black grain into a fine powder using a machine, and then filters water through it to produce a black liquid.
Asuma
It's merely roasted corn mixed with artificial caffeine. It's one of the first things that was ever developed in this facility.
Kaito
I've read about it, but I've never tried it.
Asuma
It's meant to keep you from getting drowsy. Real coffee plants that grew on the surface naturally contained caffeine.

I bring the mug to my lips and take a mouthful.
Kaito
It's pretty bitter.
Asuma
The day you come to enjoy the taste is the day we can call you a true researcher.

He says as raises his cup to his lips as well.
Asuma
Now, did you figure out the biggest flaw of the virtual space on that little trip?
Kaito
...
Asuma
Was that space indistinguishable from reality?
Kaito
I think so?

He watches me, a smile playing across his lips.
Asuma
Give it a good think. You were able to stay for about thirty minutes, but there's a reason why you wouldn't be able to stay there all day. And that would be...

I recall my experience in the virtual space.

I could move as naturally as I can in the real world.

The temperature felt right.

I could feel the ground beneath my feet.

I could even hear my footsteps.

...

After a moment of reflection, I finally realize.
Kaito
The smell. There was no scent.
Asuma
Exactly.
Kaito
Now I get it. If you're simulating the virtual space by manipulating the thalamus, then…
Kaito
You can't control any sensory data that doesn't run through the thalamus.
Kaito
The sense of smell doesn't really use the thalamus, therefore...

I mutter to no one in particular as I recall the things I learned when I looked into Mom's condition.
Asuma
You really know your stuff, huh?

He looks genuinely surprised by my familiarity with the topic.
Asuma
You are absolutely right. And with that knowledge, you should be able to figure out why it's such a fatal design flaw.
Kaito
If the sensory feedback inside of the virtual space is realized by the external use of the thalamus...
Kaito
Then you'd need an entirely new approach to recreate the sense of smell.
Asuma
Exactly. A world that lacks one of the five senses isn't a world fit to live in.
Asuma
This approach has reached a dead end.
Kaito
So we need to think of an entirely new fundamental theory.

He gives me a solemn nod.
Kaito
...

I wonder about Yonagi's dreamscape.

Does it have any smell?

...

I've never thought about it before now.
Asuma
Not all of my research so far would be wasted, of course. The simulation data of all my subjects so far can be used to streamline the process of creating patch files to fit each person's individual needs.
Asuma
If we weren't able to automate the process at some level, debugging would be the work of a lifetime.
Asuma
Right now, I'm looking for a new way to approach the project. Though I guess fumbling in the dark would be a more appropriate way to put it.
Asuma
Of course, as your advisor, I'll teach you everything I know.
Asuma
But in this lab, you and I are equals. We start by sharing ideas, and working towards the same goal.
Asuma
Let me warn you, though: you might spend your entire life drinking this bitter coffee and talking until dawn without actually accomplishing anything.
Asuma
Knowing that, do you still want to work in this lab?
Kaito
Of course!
Kaito
I'd like nothing more. I didn't expect that I could jump right in to doing cutting-edge research.

Professor Asuma gives me a warm smile.
Asuma
I feel the same way. Never could I have dreamed of welcoming such an excellent and enthusiastic researcher into this lab.

He gets up and holds out his hand.
Asuma
Thank you for holding out hope in my research. Let's see this dream through together.
Kaito
Yes!

I stand in a hurry, wipe the palm of my hand on my pants, and clasp his hand as firmly as I can.
Asuma
Welcome to the Asuma lab.
Kaito
I'll do everything I can to find a new way forward for mankind.
Asuma
No need to be quite so nervous. We're in this for the long run. Part of your job, starting today, is to enjoy your research.
Kaito
Yes!

The professor used the rest of the day to tell me about the various methods he's attempted to further his research and the current avenues he's looking into.

The basic premise of his idea is to directly tamper with a person's brain signals to create almost the same perception as if the body was really moving in the physical world.

The biggest roadblock to this would be...

The inability to secure subjects to test such a thing.

One cannot just perform experiments on humans unless their safety can be guaranteed.

That's why he has no choice but to rely on preexisting research.

Going through the data from when humans lived on the surface, you'll see that in the long history of brain science, there were certain points where rapid advancements were made.

For example, when wars broke out.

Securing corpses with their brains intact must have been easy during times of war.

Or if you found an injured person whose brain was damaged, you could study what role the damaged part played.

As a result, understanding of the brain advanced, and we used this knowledge to make new weapons of war.

It's quite ironic.

In that sense, going underground had a chilling effect on the advance of science.

While life may not be perfect, we live in peace.

This Shinjuku settlement would be more akin to what the surface people would have called a "village" once upon a time.

Though if human history is anything to go by, it's obvious that if there were physical networks linking the underground cities, conflict and wars would break out at some point in time.

As things stand, intentional murder is a rare occurrence here in the underground.

And that's why Asuma lab has hit a snag.

It's quite a somber thought.
Yonagi
Hello there, handsome!

Yonagi's cheerful tone pulls me out from my thoughts. I look up to see her waving at me.
Yonagi
How was your first day as a researcher?
Kaito
Pretty good, I think.
Yonagi
That's my boy!
Kaito
I got here early, so picked up a book to read.
Yonagi
What's it about?
Kaito
The brain.
Yonagi
You sure like that stuff, huh? You read it all the time.

I nod.
Kaito
I suppose it's my life's work now. So yeah, I do like it.

Looking up from the book, I smile at Yonagi.
Kaito
And from now on, it's my job, too.

She gifts me another one of her sweet smiles in response.
Yonagi
I better get lookin' too!
Kaito
Shakespeare, I presume?
Yonagi
Yep! I also need some reference material on what England was like during the surface era.

Now that I'm a junior researcher, I can borrow thirty books at a time.

Any book that multiple researchers would want to reference was digitized long ago, so there's almost no competition for paper books.

I'm sure most of the useful data is available in digital format, but there'll always be things that slip through the cracks.

Back when books were made with paper, paper books were primary sources.

Somebody has to make the decision on what to digitize.

And when information is curated like that, it stops being a primary source at all.

And with my memory condition, I can afford to read more than just the bullet points. It'd be silly not to make the most of it.

I can cram my brain with all the seemingly superfluous information without any drawbacks.

If I'm going to be helping Professor Asuma, I need to have as broad a range of knowledge in my head as possible to help give me ideas during our discussions.
Yonagi
Whoa... So it looks like people ate out a lot in England back in the old days. It wasn't just a Japan thing.
Kaito
Mhm.
Yonagi
Old England had places called pubs where people gathered every night to eat and drink.
Kaito
Mm...
Yonagi
Wha—! Kaito, you gotta hear this!
Kaito
Yes?
Yonagi
It says that women couldn't act on stage back then! Why not?!
Kaito
I couldn't tell you.
Yonagi
You're not even listening to me...
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Hmm, this is so eye-opening. So this is the world Shakespeare lived in.
Yonagi
Kaito?
Kaito
Mm?
Yonagi
Can I take out a few books too?
Kaito
Of course.
Yonagi
Yay!
Yonagi
I got assigned to replace the water pipes in the west area today.
Kaito
Huh, that brings back memories. Is the chief doing well?
Yonagi
You don't even know the half of it! He just came back from a dispatch to the power generation area, and he was so happy when I told him about you!
Yonagi
He's so impressed with you becoming a big fancy doctor!
Kaito
There's no PhDs anymore though. Only junior researchers and researchers.
Yonagi
Gee, thanks for the history lesson! How much more can you even study? Your head's gonna turn into a literal book.
Kaito
I hope it doesn't happen anytime soon, because I haven't achieved a thing yet.
Kaito
I'm not even close to the finish line.
Yonagi
Mm... So your thirst for knowledge is unquenchable, huh?
Kaito
I think that's true for all scientists. The more you learn and widen your horizons, the more you want to know.
Kaito
Actually, I guess it'd be more apt to say that you're increasingly aware of the things you don't know.
Yonagi
Is it fun?
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
You keep going because it's fun to learn more, right?
Kaito
...

Is it?

I thought about it, but I felt it was different.
Kaito
No, it's so that someday we can have fun…

I turn to her and gather my thoughts.
Kaito
I'm working hard now so we can have a good life together in the future. So we can be happy together.

Yonagi's eyes widen, but then she smiles fondly at me.
Yonagi
I'm having lots of fun right now.
Kaito
But there's so much more.

As we walk, I look up at the ozone lens.
Kaito
There's the middle side above us, and above them is the top side. And no one even knows what's out there on the surface.
Yonagi
As long as I'm with you, I'm happy enough being a lowsider.
Kaito
But if we lived in the middle side, you'd be even happier. It's just like what I said about knowledge.
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
I'm sure we can be happier up there. We just don't know it.
Kaito
It's only after we're up there that we'll realize how hard life was down here.
Yonagi
I wonder about that.
Yonagi
Even if that were the case, it doesn't mean that our happiness right now will disappear, will it?

I turn my gaze from the middle side cityscape back to Yonagi.
Kaito
First we need to know what life is like there. And soon, we will.

I take her hand in mine and give it a good squeeze.
Yonagi
Mhm.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
I got some synth milk today.

The mention of milk brings back a memory that makes me chuckle.
Kaito
If Izumo gets her hands on it we're gonna get boiled milk with corn again.

Yonagi also breaks into a sweet giggle.
Yonagi
Aw, that's fine. She says it's good for digestion!
Yonagi
And the taste of warm milk is calming, too. I've gotten used to it.
Kaito
I suppose our chef does a good job.

We walk to the elevator together, holding hands and talking about our day.
Yonagi
I actually read something interesting today. Apparently there was a dish called porridge in England a long time ago.
Kaito
Porridge?

She turns to me with a gleam in her eyes.
Yonagi
So you make it by like, mixing milk and boiled grains together into a mush.
Kaito
Is it any good?
Yonagi
We eat it all the time!
Kaito
...

I suppose corn is a kind of grain.

We do eat it pretty much all the time, and Izumo's idea of mixing things up is just to add hot milk.
Yonagi
Izumo's favorite dish was porridge this whole time, and we didn't even notice!
Kaito
Hah, that's funny.
Yonagi
I wonder what she'll say when I tell her about it!
Yonagi
We're back!
Kaito
Hello there.
Izumo
Welcome home.
Yonagi
Here's today's rations. Hey, Izumo! I learned that the dish you make for us all the time is called porridge.
Izumo
Porridge?

Yonagi nods, a satisfied smile on her face.

Izumo glances my way.

While her expression betrays no emotion, I sense an inkling of confusion behind it.
Kaito
Supposedly the dish you make with boiled corn and synth milk is called porridge.
Yonagi
Yeah, exactly!
Yonagi
The one you make all the time! The one you're really good at cooking!
Izumo
I am not good at cooking.
Yonagi
But your food is delicious! Isn't that right, Kaito?
Kaito
Huh? Y-Yeah.

Yonagi shoots me a disapproving glance.
Kaito
I mean, I never get bored of it, and it's not bad. I'd say you're pretty good at it, sure.
Kaito
Once I made a really awful dish of porridge.
Kaito
Since it's theoretically possible to make bad porridge, the fact that you make it delicious every time means you're good at making it.
Yonagi
Gosh, what a prince charming.
Kaito
...

She lets out an exasperated sigh.
Yonagi
Ignore him, Izumo. Kaito can be like that sometimes.
Yonagi
You're gonna make your best dish tonight, right? I even brought some synth milk.
Izumo
I'll begin preparing at once.

Izumo turns towards the kitchen and begins preparing dinner. Yonagi watches her and smiles.

After finishing dinner and putting away the dishes, Yonagi piles the books on Shakespeare and England she borrowed today up on the table.
Kaito
Yonagi, think you could show me something?
Yonagi
Anything in particular?
Kaito
The usual. Or any of the worlds you made. Anything.

Is there smell inside Yonagi's dreamscape?

I need to make sure.
Yonagi
Okay, I've got just the thing.

After a moment of deliberation, she extends her hand to me.

I clasp it and close my eyes.
Kaito
...

This is a new place.

I look around me.

It's similar to descriptions I've read of old European towns.
Olivia (Yonagi)
Well met! Welcome to Tenbridge!
Kaito
...

As per usual, I can't speak.

I felt more free in the professor's virtual space.
Olivia (Yonagi)
This is the city of Tenbridge, nestled in the heart of England. The city of theater!
Olivia (Yonagi)
And my name is Olivia Berry, actress.
Kaito
...

I cock my head to the side.
Olivia (Yonagi)
What are you looking at?
Olivia (Yonagi)
I coined the word, for there is no other that describes one such as me!
Kaito
...

Next, I look up at the sky.
Olivia (Yonagi)
Kaito?

I can feel a faint breeze blowing on my face.

The sky above us is a blanket of blue.

I take a deep breath.

And there it is—a smell.

However...

I let go of Yonagi's hand, and we're back to reality.
Kaito
It smelled like Shinjuku.
Yonagi
Smell?
Kaito
Yonagi, let me smell you.
Yonagi
Huh? Smell? Why?
Kaito
I'm trying to figure something out.
Yonagi
You want to smell me? Why?!
Kaito
No, Olivia's.
Yonagi
???????????
Kaito
I need to smell Olivia. I have to.
Yonagi
What? What are you even talking about? You're seriously creeping me out.
Kaito
It's important, Yonagi.

I take her hand again and close my eyes.
Yonagi
Hyah?!

I walk up to the transformed Yonagi, cup her cheeks, and bring my face close to hers.

She's giving off a familiar scent.

It's...
Kaito
It smells like you.
Yonagi
Wh-Wh-What's going on? Did they do something to you at the institute?! Where did you pick up this strange fetish?!
Kaito
Why does she smell like you?
Yonagi
You're freaking me out! When did you turn into a psycho?
Kaito
Isn't Olivia supposed to smell more, err, womanly or something?
Yonagi
What?! Now you insult me?!
Kaito
*Sniff*

I bring my face close to hers and drink in the scent.
Kaito
Yeah, it's just you.
Yonagi
I don't think I've ever felt humiliated in this particular way before!
Kaito
*Sniff*
Yonagi
I mean... I don't even know how old England is supposed to smell!
Kaito
Ah, so that's it. I see...

I let go of Yonagi.

So that place smells like Shinjuku...

...because she doesn't know how the surface smells.
Kaito
*Sniff*

Tenbridge didn't smell like this house, but like the lower side.

I couldn't smell Izumo's porridge in there either.

In other words, it didn't smell like the real space we're in right now.
Yonagi
Hnnghh!
Kaito
Mm? What's wrong?

Above her flushed cheeks, tears are pooling in Yonagi's eyes.
Yonagi
Pervert! You researcher with kinky proclivities!
Kaito
...

I see now. Since Yonagi hasn't experienced any other scents, Tenbridge defaults to what she knows.

Which means...
Yonagi
And all you're gonna do is smell me? That's it?!
Kaito
...

If I expose her to more scents, would that enrich the variety of scents in her dreamscape?

It's an interesting notion, certainly. I think it warrants some testing.

So...
Yonagi
Are you even listening to me?!

There's a high chance that the professor's virtual space and Yonagi's dreamscape are created in completely different ways.
Kaito
I see...
Yonagi
Stop seeing and start listening, would you?!

The next day, I enter the lab and encounter professor Asuma already sitting at his desk.

After learning how to make coffee from him yesterday, I take the opportunity to brew cups for both of us.
Asuma
Virtual spaces became widely used about 150 years ago.
Asuma
Research and development of VR-related software and hardware was booming up until the year 2046.
Kaito
2046? Did it suddenly decline in popularity for any particular reason?
Asuma
Records show that back then, humanity was making use of a large-scale organic telecommunication system. But after the network was hacked, people came to harbor a deep distrust of technology in general.
Kaito
Organic telecommunication systems, huh?

I've read about that period before.

If I remember right...
Kaito
The artificial pigeons, right?

The professor nods.
Asuma
Yes, birds. Creatures that soared in the skies.
Kaito
So are there still many of those birds on the surface today?
Asuma
No. External networks were no longer needed once telecommunications had progressed to their current state. Around the year 2100, all the birds were retired and taken out of service.
Kaito
Current state... You mean the internal chips?
Asuma
Exactly. When you have direct connections between people, you don’t need most of the functions a network provides.
Kaito
And those functions were…?
Asuma
Information sharing.
Asuma
Back then, it was all done indirectly. Data was uploaded to and stored in huge central servers that could be accessed when needed.
Asuma
Now, every single person is a walking communications device, and their own personal data storage vault. Not that anyone is really aware of it.

A huge interconnected server, huh? There's certainly no such thing in Shinjuku. We probably wouldn't have the electricity to power it.

But the biometric chips, the basic intercommunication methods… All that was common in the surface era. So..
Kaito
Why are we still using those while the virtual space was abandoned?
Asuma
There is no one single reason. But if you think about what we're trying to reproduce with the virtual space right now...

The professor trails off, clearly inviting me to finish the thought.
Kaito
The surface world.
Asuma
Yes. A city, the symbol of an advanced civilization. And a natural world where the sun shines down, the wind blows, and the rain falls.

I nod along.
Asuma
They had all that on the surface from the start. Why virtually reproduce something you can just walk out of your door to see?
Asuma
All the spaces created for the virtual world were ultimately fake. It caught the attention of people for a few decades, but ran its course as fads tend to do.
Kaito
I see.
Asuma
It was only after losing the surface and being forced underground that mankind realized the true beauty of nature.
Asuma
You really don't know what you have until it's gone. That applies to both women and life.

The professor chuckles at his own comment.
Asuma
The virtual space that was created on the surface was but a toy. Despite already living in an ideal world, they sought a paper thin ideal that couldn't stand up to scrutiny.
Kaito
I remember reading a parable like that once in a book from the surface.

The professor nods, a note of excitement tinging his voice.
Asuma
Maeterlinck's 'The Blue Bird'. You really are well read.
Kaito
I've always liked stories.

Or rather, Yonagi does.
Kaito
So even back then, there were people who realized that the grass always looks greener on the other side.
Asuma
A hundred years separate the time Maeterlinck lived in and the development of the virtual space.
Asuma
But perhaps there were such people, yes. Like in any era, there were people who mastered technology, people who became slaves to it, and people who hated it.
Kaito
Maybe the ones who mastered it, and the ones who hated it, both had the foresight to understand what you're describing.

The professor nods and takes a sip of his coffee.

After talking with Professor Asuma into the evening, I swing by the workshop.

The printer he used to help me make my car all those years ago is still in the same place.

It brings back so many memories.

I was with Yonagi back then.

Actually, that reminds me—she's been in a sour mood since yesterday night.

But I haven't the faintest idea as to why.

I pray she's in a better mood when I get home.

I need her to help me out again tonight.

I came here to prepare for that, actually.

First of all, I need to print some scents.

I choose some cartridges for the aroma printers and set them up.

The scent of a clear day under the sun. The smell of rain.

Meadows, seas, and forests.

This should cover most natural environments.

And also…

The scents of herbs, flowers, and fruits.

The machine aeresolizes the scents I chose into particles before printing them into small capsules.

I carefully stow the capsules in my bag and leave the institute behind.

All the capsules I printed out clink together inside my bag as I head towards home.

I can't wait to have Yonagi help me today.

I can hardly contain my excitement as the house comes into view.
Yonagi
Welcome home!
Kaito
Hey there. I need your help tonight.
Yonagi
I don't want to get sniffed again.
Kaito
Oh, no, you're doing the sniffing today.
Yonagi
What the hell? No way! I don't wanna sniff you!
Kaito
What are you talking about? You don't need to sniff me.
Kaito
Where did you get that idea?
Yonagi
Excuse me? Izumo, can you back me up here?!
Izumo
I will prepare dinner.
Yonagi
Why is there not a single soul in this house I can have a proper conversation with?!

After we're done eating Izumo's porridge, I fish out the capsules from my bag and line them up on the table.

I notice that Yonagi's still reading books about 16th century England.
Yonagi
What are those?
Kaito
Smells from the surface.
Yonagi
Smells…?

I nod enthusiastically.
Kaito
This one should smell like a grassy meadow, for example.

I open up the meadow capsule for her.
Yonagi
Whoa! So this is how it smells.
Kaito
I also have the smell of a city.
Yonagi
Different places have different smells?
Kaito
Seems so.
Yonagi
Ooh, can I smell the others too?
Kaito
Sure.
Yonagi
This is... chamomile? What's that?
Kaito
A species of herb that has a strong scent. It was in the first encyclopedia you ever showed me.
Yonagi
Yeah?
Kaito
It's a basic herb. You don't remember?
Yonagi
Uh, of course not? How many years ago was that?

Yonagi frowns and squints at me.

The frown turns upside down the next second, so I realize she's not actually mad.
Yonagi
Can I open it?
Kaito
Go right ahead.

Yonagi takes the capsule and opens it, then bring it closer to her face.
Yonagi
It smells so different! I thought meadows were just full of weeds.
Kaito
The molecular composition of the two are different. The nasal cavity has about four hundred receptors that perceive different smells by—
Yonagi
I think I like this smell!

Yonagi declares, a smile lighting up her whole face.

But the olfactory system is so interesting…

Especially how the nasal secretions serve as both protectors and carriers of odor molecules in the nose. The whole topic is so interesting.

...Oh well. Maybe I'll be able to talk about it another day.
Kaito
That smell is apparently very reminiscent of apples.
Yonagi
I've never even seen fancy fruits like that. I'm no topsider.
Kaito
I got the smell of apples here if you want to compare.
Yonagi
Ooh!

I open the apple capsule and hand it to her.
Yonagi
They do smell kinda similar!
Yonagi
So this is what an apple smells like.
Kaito
I brought the scents of some flowers too. I learned that there was something called perfume on the surface. People used to make scents from flowers and cover themselves in them.
Yonagi
Mhm!
Yonagi
This is so fun! I was definitely creeped out yesterday, but I think I'm starting to see why you developed a smell fetish now.
Kaito
Huh?
Kaito
I don't have a fetish, though?
Yonagi
What?
Yonagi
Didn't you literally sniff me all night yesterday?
Yonagi
And then you bring all these scents home? Now you're gonna tell me that you don't have a weird fixation on smells?
Kaito
No, in Professor Asuma's virtual space, I...
Yonagi
Oh? Now you change the topic?
Kaito
No, no! The virtual space has this big flaw. You can't smell anything inside of it.
Kaito
The current method the professor is using involves externally manipulating the thalamus, but most olfactory information isn't processed through the thalamus.
Yonagi
I really can't follow when you start talking about brain stuff.
Yonagi
So you were sniffing me yesterday for research purposes?
Kaito
Why else would I be?
Yonagi
Kaito, my boy?
Kaito
Yes?
Yonagi
Hearken to my words. I want you to listen real well to what I'm about to say. You know how people are supposed to communicate and say why they do things before actually doing them?
Yonagi
You understand what I'm trying to say, yes?

I nod at her.

Ever since she read a Japanese novel from around the seventeenth century, she's started speaking funny sometimes.

It's weirdly old-timey, but I find it endearing.
Yonagi
And this is hardly the first time we've had this talk, is it?

I shake my head.
Kaito
Today makes the sixteenth time. I think that's a good stopping point.
Yonagi
A good stopping point?
Kaito
It's one of the powers of two. A beautiful, almost mystical number.
Yonagi
Well then, you better make sure there isn't a seventeenth time!

I nod in agreement.
Kaito
Seventeen is a prime number. It only believes in itself, and the number 1. It doesn't get along with the other numbers.
Yonagi
I care not!
Yonagi
Whoa, this smells so nice.
Kaito
This is rose. It used to be real popular.
Yonagi
Ooh, so this is the scent Queen Elizabeth liked!
Kaito
Really?

She bobs her head enthusiastically.
Yonagi
She loved it enough for people to call her the queen of roses.
Kaito
I see.
Yonagi
It has kind of a refined, lady-like scent. I wonder if Olivia would smell like this.
Kaito
I imagine rose perfume must have been popular at the time. Not something the common people would've had access to, though.
Yonagi
It's okay! Olivia lives in the house of an aristocrat!
Kaito
So it would make sense for her to smell fancy like that, yeah?
Yonagi
Yep, I think so.
Yonagi
I never thought about how my characters might smell before, but this really helps me visualize them better.
Kaito
Now try picking a smell for the town.
Yonagi
The feeling I get from what I read is that Europe wasn't really a clean place around that time.
Yonagi
But it doesn't have to be that THAT realistic, right? I think a meadow smell would be nice! Yeah, this one!
Kaito
All right.
Yonagi
So, what do I do?
Kaito
When you take me to your dreamscape, you show me the world you envision, right?
Kaito
First, I want to see if I can smell the scents you put into your world. I'd like to take this step by step.
Yonagi
Step by step, you say.
Kaito
Let's try a scent that both of us know first.
Kaito
And then we'll try a scent that only you know. For example...

I pick up one of the capsules and hand it over to her.
Kaito
This is the scent of a flower called sweet osmanthus. I don't know how it smells.
Yonagi
Funny name.
Kaito
I want to know if you can reproduce a scent only you know and transmit it to me accurately.
Kaito
If you can create the scent in the dreamscape, I can smell it from the capsule afterwards and see if it's the same.
Yonagi
I see. So it's gonna be like a guess the scent game!
Kaito
I suppose that's a way to put it.
Yonagi
Sounds fun.
Kaito
If I can perceive scents in your dreamscape, I might be able to figure out what's going on in my brain when it happens and then reproduce it.
Kaito
It would help the professor's research immensely.
Yonagi
Oh, right. You said his research has kind of fallen by the wayside, right?

I nod.
Yonagi
So I'm doing this for you and Professor Asuma... Okay! Guess I don't mind lending you a hand!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Kaito?
Kaito
...

The scent of wind.

This is it.

The world the professor and I wanted to recreate.

The scent of a wind that doesn't exist in Shinjuku.

Under a bright, blue sky.
Yonagi
It smells so nice.
Yonagi
Wow... I can't believe people used to live in such a beautiful place.

It's hard to explain how much difference adding scents makes.

It makes me feel so free, so immersed in this space.

It's on a whole different level.

Like a literal whole new world.

But I have no time to marvel at it.

Can I reproduce this?
Kaito
Yonagi, how about Olivia?
Yonagi
Ah, right. Okay...
Yonagi
What do you think?
Kaito
...

I approach Olivia slowly.

Her scent is just like Yonagi envisioned.

Sweet, rich, and almost dazzling.

I could smell it clearly.

I approach her then take a step back.
Kaito
...
Kaito
...I see.
Yonagi
Is something wrong?
Kaito
No...

The moment you solve one problem, another rears its head.

It's the nature of research.
Kaito
Okay, what next? Can we go indoors?
Yonagi
Okay.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Did you figure something out?
Kaito
...

While I can't answer her question in this space, I have realized something important.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
So, did that help?
Kaito
The concentration of the scent is ignoring the laws of physics.
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
Smells are made up of particles suspended in the air. They diffuse and move freely through the air in three dimensions.
Kaito
The concentration of the scent should become weaker in inverse proportion to the cube of the distance it travels.
Yonagi
Uhhh?
Kaito
But the smells are all uniform inside your dreamscape.
Kaito
Which means...
Kaito
The scents inside of your dreamscape are experienced exactly as you envision them in your mind.
Kaito
It doesn't take into account how far away they are from the source.
Kaito
Ah...

Something sticks out to me about what I just said. It feels like two unconnected things are about to connect.

I close my eyes and go back through my memories.
Kaito
I see... We could solve it by...

Data was uploaded to and stored in huge central servers.

I could use what the professor had told me about networks from the old surface era today.
Kaito
I think I have a new idea. It may even make me able to speak in your dreamscape.
Yonagi
What? I'm really not following you.
Kaito
Let me explain.
Kaito
What I'm seeing in your dreamscape right now...
Kaito
... is probably the image you're creating in your mind.
Kaito
There's visual feedback, sound, touch, and smell there.
Kaito
But I'm merely receiving and processing it.
Yonagi
Mm, right.
Kaito
That's why smell doesn't work like it's supposed to, because I'm just a spectator.
Kaito
I never noticed before, but I'm probably even hearing sounds at the same volume I would if I were standing where you were.
Kaito
It's so obvious in hindsight. No one would bother to think about how the five senses of someone else would perceive the same things.
Kaito
That's why you have no problem showing me things that exist only in your mind, like the worlds you picture in your novels, for example.

Yonagi looks over her conceptual sketches for a moment.
Yonagi
So does that mean you won't ever be able to speak in there? No matter what we do?
Kaito
Well...

I ponder for a long moment.

Her dreamscape was unidirectional. If you wanted everyone inside to perceive the actions of a participant…
Kaito
Oh, there is a way.
Kaito
But it's not gonna happen.
Yonagi
What do you mean?
Kaito
The participant would need to have the same power as you.
Kaito
Then instead of unidirectional transmission, it would be bi-directional. You could each share your mental  images to each other in real time, and what might happen is that the two fuse together.
Yonagi
I see...
Kaito
But we don't know anyone that may have the same abilities as you. Does such a person even exist?
Yonagi
If they do, we've never met them.
Kaito
But this is what I want to do, in essence.
Kaito
Basically, I want to convert this unilateral dreamscape into a two-way street.
Kaito
But even this two-way dreamscape is impractical. It can't be generalized.
Yonagi
Generalized?
Kaito
There's a condition for being able to participate, right? It's only two-way if someone has the same power you do.
Kaito
So...
Kaito
Maybe, instead of communicating your thoughts directly into someone's mind, you could send them to an external server first.
Kaito
\\f-4;The process you naturally use to send images and sensations to other people must be the same as the process the body uses to send sensory information to the brain, so it should be possible to convert it into electrical signals.
Yonagi
Mm...
Kaito
\\f-4;The server could take into account things like the distance between you and me or the nature of the space around us, and use it to make the sensory information work in accordance with real physical laws.
Kaito
There's lots of libraries for handling physics in virtual spaces, so we won't need to make one ourselves.
Yonagi
Libraries? As in, the one in the institute?
Kaito
No, it's what we call blocks of code with functions that are commonly used.
Kaito
If we could set this up, we could use the same system we use to send bio signals to Izumo to transmit brain signals.
Kaito
I can't send images into people's brains like you can, though.
Yonagi
Do you need to use the biochips for this to work?
Kaito
Yeah.

Every single inhabitant of this city has a nanochip installed in them that acts as a personal identification and records their biometric data.

But while all lowsiders have them, it doesn't mean they'll receive medical care if the data shows a problem.

It makes me wonder why they even bother in the first place.
Kaito
And the integrated virtual environment we make together could be shared to other participants using Asuma Lab's current technology.
Kaito
If we do use this setup, we could create a dreamscape that can integrate each person's perception, no matter how many people are in the system.
Yonagi
So if we do this...
Yonagi
You could talk with Mom again?
Kaito
It may be possible. If the perception of a particular person is strong enough in all of the participants...
Yonagi
What does that mean?
Kaito
That space would no longer be the manifestation of your image alone.
Kaito
It would become an amalgamation of the perceptions of all the people participating in it.
Yonagi
Mm...
Kaito
In that situation, if we wanted to create an embodiment of a dead person in that space...
Kaito
It'd need all the participants.
Kaito
Or almost all of them. You would need enough people with the same image of the person to be able to treat the signals coming from the people who didn't know them as noise that could be discarded.
Kaito
Like God, perhaps.
Yonagi
God?

I nod.
Kaito
In other words, everyone needs to know who this person is, and have a shared awareness of what they look like and what kind of person they are.
Kaito
Someone like that, like God, for instance, might be made manifest inside that space.
Yonagi
A world where God manifests…
Yonagi
It sounds kind of romantic, doesn't it?
Kaito
For that to happen, though, everyone inside the thought space would have to want them to appear.
Kaito
Right now, it's just you and me, and we both know mom well. If we both share the same mental image of her…
Kaito
It could be possible if we figure out this server deal in detail.

I look up.
Kaito
Think you could do it?
Yonagi
Excuse me?
Kaito
Send your mental image to a machine.
Kaito
We'd need to send it to an intermediary server first in order to make it work.
Yonagi
Mm, I've never tried to do it with anything other than a person.
Yonagi
And... I kind of don't like the idea of anyone but you looking into what's in my mind, to be honest.
Kaito
Even if it's a machine?
Yonagi
Mm...

Yonagi bites on her lower lip as she ponders.
Yonagi
...Well, I suppose I wouldn't mind if it was Izumo.
Kaito
Izumo, huh?
Izumo
Mm?

I mull over her words for a moment.

Izumo's OS is powerful enough, to be fair.

However, android operating systems have iron-clad security to stop hacking.

That's one of the main reasons I've been unable to restore all the functions that were broken when she was thrown away.

I can't even increase the amount of dishes in her food repertoire.

There's definitely no way I can add in new functions.

We'll need some kind of auxiliary device between us and Izumo.

The only such function of hers that remains is a number calculation process that gives results in response to external input. In other words, she can solve math problems.

Still, her computing power is extremely high.

There isn't a faster or more sophisticated computer than Izumo, at least in the low side.

If we're making an integrated dreamscape, faster processing power will mean less lag.

And with Izumo's power, the delay would be pretty much unnoticeable for our brains.

However...
Kaito
By the way.
Yonagi
Mm?
Kaito
Why would you be okay with Izumo?
Yonagi
Well, she's family. I can trust her. Plus, she's cute.
Kaito
Cute…

So as long as the auxiliary device is cute and feels like family, she's okay with it?
Kaito
...

I put my hand up against my forehead.

After a moment of thinking...

I realize that's a tall order.

The next day, Professor Asuma shows up in the lab in the afternoon.
Asuma
Ah, Kaito. Good day. Sorry, we had a general debriefing today.
Kaito
Debriefing?

He directs a pleasant smile at me and explains.
Asuma
All researchers in the institute are called to a debriefing whenever a remarkable discovery is made.
Asuma
Well, it's pretty much a presentation to convince the higher ups to assign a bigger budget when the possibility of a breakthrough is found.
Kaito
I see.
Asuma
Today's debriefing was from a group of researchers developing a type of UV protective agent that is applied to the skin. They were allotted more researchers and budget for their studies.
Kaito
More researchers?

The professor's affable expression turns a few shades sadder.
Asuma
Sorry about that. We used to have more researchers here.
Kaito
Oh, no, don't apologize.
Asuma
While we're on the topic, why don't we take the day to discuss current research trends at the institute? Not like what you read in the monthly journals they release, but what I know from being on the inside.
Kaito
That'd be great.

We move in front of the lab's digital board to talk.

He speaks of the city's distribution systems, power generation, and storage methods for relics from the surface era, such as clothing.

He tells me about the general lines of research being explored and the city's history with remarkable eloquence and simplicity.

All of this is news to me.
Kaito
I see. So only now are we ready to try and move back to the surface.
Asuma
The standard of living here in the underground has finally hit an acceptable level. Back in the surface era, it was always the most advanced countries that set their sights on space.
Asuma
Shinjuku was the first underground city created in Japan. Thus, we're at the vanguard when it comes to research as well.
Kaito
But we still don't have any pills that work on UV rays?
Asuma
We do, but none of them work that well.
Asuma
If anything, they seem to serve as a striking example of the placebo effect.
Kaito
Oh...
Asuma
Why do you believe that is?
Kaito
Uh...
Kaito
Back when I was a student, I remember you once showed the class an image of a patient suffering from melanoma.
Asuma
Ah, that was a primary education lesson, yes? You have quite the memory.
Kaito
It terrified me. And I think, at the same time...
Kaito
Despite knowing the ozone lens was above us, I felt fear at the idea of living in the top side.
Asuma
I see.
Kaito
That's when I started wondering if the topsiders were doing anything in particular about it. Like taking some kind of medicine just to make sure nothing happened to them.
Asuma
...

He says nothing as he sips on his coffee.
Asuma
There are various reasons why the people in the top side are fine. First and foremost, the robust construction of the ozone lens.
Asuma
Since the day we humans moved underground, there hasn't been a single case of a human contracting and dying from melanoma under the ozone lens.
Asuma
Their safety is perfectly guaranteed. The topsiders especially seem to prefer safety data when it comes in the form of hard numbers.
Kaito
I see.
Asuma
There's the matter of education as well. You're a lowsider, right? You must know better than anyone how much better off the topsiders are when it comes to learning opportunities.

I nod back.

While Yonagi and I toiled, they had time to study. There's also a special education curriculum just for them.
Asuma
As you say, the topsiders are the ones closest to the sun. In the extremely unlikely event that the ozone lens were to somehow fail or collapse...
Asuma
They would be the first and most numerous victims. That's why the gathering of knowledge is so important for them.
Asuma
Knowledge to fulfill their role as the topsiders of our city.
Kaito
Their role?
Asuma
They are the ones who think about the distribution of our limited food and water throughout the city, and it's also their job to make the occasional risky trip to make observations on the surface.
Asuma
There are also topsider-only labs that research and develop androids, too.
Kaito
I see... An android wouldn't have any trouble being exposed to UV rays. So that's why.

Izumo's blank face flashes through my mind.
Kaito
I'd like to take a look at those labs they have up there.

The affable smile returns to his face.
Asuma
When you're in a position to look into that, you will learn how. That's how this city operates.
Asuma
Though if we were to look back at the long, twisting labyrinth of human society, you could say that we have been repeating the same pattern for as long as we have existed.
Asuma
Lowsiders will aim to become midsiders, and midsiders will aim to become topsiders. And in the same way, every person in this city yearns to leave the ozone lens behind.
Asuma
Despite us having dug our own hole and hidden in it to begin with.
Asuma
I'm sure the same would happen to our virtual space in time. One day, inevitably, people will yearn to experience the real, waking surface world. It's easy to picture.
Asuma
Even I could be simply retracing the same history that humankind has repeated time and time again. In the end, this research may serve to do nothing but satisfy my own ego.

His eyes wander over his desk, his gaze seemingly a thousand miles away.
Kaito
I don't know about that.

Professor Asuma's gaze focuses on me again.

The memory of my late mother comes to mind.
Kaito
For example, there are people out there who are paralyzed.
Kaito
Would those people have any reason to want to return to the real world?
Kaito
Even if a solution to the UV rays is found, moving to the surface would be difficult for such people.

He simply stares at me as I speak.

His face betrays no emotion whatsoever.
Kaito
The first thing that struck me about your research was how much kindness I felt from the whole concept. That's what gripped me.
Asuma
Kindness?
Kaito
Your idea seemed to be made to help all the people living here. The bedridden ones, or the ones who can only move about for short periods of time.
Kaito
It includes everyone, as long as they're cognizant. I felt that your desire to help as many as possible was really kind.

He studies me with his gaze.

A long silence descends on the lab.

But after a moment, his smile comes back, and he finally speaks again.
Asuma
...Perhaps my venting was too heavy-handed.
Asuma
I can see how you'd arrive at the conclusion that I am angry about the current state of things.
Asuma
I've never given up on my research for that very same reason you speak of.
Asuma
Frustration is no reason for being a sore loser, and it was unbecoming of me to let it poison my words. I hope you can forgive me.
Kaito
There's nothing to forgive...

He looks over the lab, and his gaze settles on the empty desks.
Asuma
I couldn't make a single statement during today's debriefing. I simply stewed in my chair.
Asuma
I read through the paper on oral medicine as well, but…It was easy to see how much my research is out of line with the prevailing trends.
Kaito
...
Asuma
Once upon a time, all the desks in this lab were in use.

I follow his gaze and look over the lab as well.

In total, there are fifteen empty desks.
Asuma
Back then, all my lab's members were treated as researchers and given accommodation in the middle side.
Asuma
It saddens me that I can't show you how the good times were.
Kaito
All researchers lived in the middle side...?
Asuma
Our meetings were veritable clashes of ideas. My chest swelled with pride at the amount of young talent, just like yourself, that my lab was blessed with.
Asuma
Among them was the one I started this laboratory with. A friend I lived joys and sorrows with throughout the years. I wish you could have known him.
Kaito
Started the laboratory? Wasn't it just you at the beginning?
Asuma
I merely had a way with words. He was the true genius behind the whole operation. I was always so jealous of him.
Kaito
You? Jealous of someone?

The professor chuckles at my obvious consternation.
Asuma
Does that surprise you?
Kaito
Y-Yes. You always seemed so confident to me...
Asuma
I'm simply sitting back and watching the years pass me by now, but there was a time when I was a passionate, hot-blooded youth just like you.

I gulped quietly.
Kaito
I see.
Asuma
If a lab shows results, they are afforded more researchers—that's just how it is. Sadly, that number is zero for us right now.
Asuma
I am certain that you would have been made a researcher by now if you chose a lab with more resources and people at its disposal. You have talent, Kaito.
Kaito
...
Asuma
You want to live in the middle side, yes?
Kaito
Yes.

It's the truth. That's one reason I'm here.
Asuma
I'll support you. I know talent and hard work when I see it, and if you're not a researcher, I don't know who is.
Asuma
I'll apply for a researcher slot, but as you can see, this lab hasn't achieved results in over a decade. Don't get your hopes up.
Kaito
Then...
Kaito
That means I must apply myself to research. If we see some results...
Kaito
I could become a midsider too.
Asuma
Exactly so. I will do my utmost to see it happen.
Kaito
Thank you.

After talking with the professor and expressing my interest in creating physics algorithms for the virtual space, Professor Asuma kindly gave me permission to make free use of the source code for the lab's sensory information manipulation software.

I wasn't sure what I'd say if he asked why I wanted it, and was glad that he didn't.

He's already done so much for me; I want to repay him with tangible results.

It would help him, and it'd help me to achieve my dream of living in the middle side.

The device developed in Asuma lab can already monitor the subject's brain waves and manipulate the thalamus externally.

Except for the sense of smell, it can recreate an immersive experience good enough to fool the brain into assuming it's reality.

The way smell is processed is much simpler than more complicated bodily functions such as sight, hearing, and balance.

When they made the device, they probably never expected that smell would be the one thing they couldn't recreate.

But it has already cleared the most difficult stages of sensory feedback processing.

By using this code, I can obtain detailed data of our brains when we're in Yonagi's dreamscape.

It'll also make the auxiliary device I need for the integrated dreamscape a lot simpler to create.

I actually have to strip away functions from it for what I need.

But this is still far more efficient than building it from the ground up.

Making the thing itself wouldn't be difficult.

However...
Kaito
What constitutes... cute?

I mutter to myself.

I try to think of things and people in my life that I find cute.

The first things to pop in my mind are Yonagi and Izumo, naturally.

They're both very cute.

But I certainly couldn't model the device after them.

Yonagi would accuse me of having some kind of sick fetish again if I tried.

She had this weird habit of accusing me of having fetishes whenever something happened.

"Cute" will need to be found somewhere else.

I should be able to create something endearing enough in her eyes. Probably.

The second best thing would be...
Kaito
An animal?

Its job will be to convey what the both of us envision.
Kaito
Mmh... Dreams... Sleeping...
Kaito
When you sleep... you count sheep... Ah, yes!

The 3D printers have a function to make scanned images into three-dimensional objects.

But I must decide on a design first.

I need to create something that she can't help but find adorable...
Kaito
...

I let my pen glide with purpose over the sheet of paper.
Kaito
Oh?

This is actually the first time I've tried drawing anything.

And yet...

I feel absolutely certain that Yonagi will find this cute.

I'm sure I can communicate my feelings to her through this art.
Kaito
You can do this, Kaito.

I feel like I finally started seeing the professor as something more than an idol today. Now he feels like a real person.

And I find myself enjoying my time with him more and more.

I'm really glad to have chosen his lab, despite everything.

His research has a strong, humane philosophy behind it.

He's not just chasing the latest technology.

It feels like the reasons we're doing this research are always at the forefront of his mind.

I want to help his research become recognized again.

I'm sure his idea is what will save this city in the end.

And now I have a part to play in it.

I've never faced such a daunting task in my life.

We have dinner together like usual, but I can't shake the restless feeling within me.
Yonagi
Thanks for the porridge, Izumo. It was delicious!
Kaito
It really was, thanks.

Izumo nods and quickly takes the empty dishes to wash.

Yonagi and I settle around the table to work like usual.
Kaito
Yonagi.
Yonagi
Yes?

Yonagi looks up at me and hugs the thick book she was poring over against her chest.
Kaito
I've been thinking about something.
Yonagi
Mhm?
Kaito
About a design that you'd find cute, and that would be like family.
Yonagi
Ah, that thing from yesterday?

I nod in response.
Yonagi
You drew something?

I nod once more.
Yonagi
That's super! I've never seen you draw before! I didn't know you could! Come on, show me!
Kaito
I hope you like it...
Yonagi
Yep, yep!
Kaito
Here it is.
Yonagi
Huh?
Izumo
...

Yonagi freezes, her gaze pinned on the sketch.
Kaito
What do you think?
Yonagi
Wh-What...
Yonagi
Wh-What's this? What is it?
Yonagi
Why does it... have those curly things popping out of its head?
Yonagi
I-Izumo?
Izumo
It's not in my data banks.
Yonagi
Let's thank God for that!
Kaito
Since the dreamscape is like, well, a dream. Sheep are associated with sleep, so I incorporated that into the design.
Yonagi
A sheep?! Th-That's a sheep?!
Kaito
Yeah, you might not remember, but sheep are—
Yonagi
I know what a sheep is! Why do you think I'm losing my mind?!
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
Don't you dare 'huh?' me! I'm the one who's confused here!
Yonagi
What even are those... hands? Wait, are they even hands?
Kaito
I'm planning to allocate points of contact for communication there. It's basically a repeater for your image projections, so it has to be able to receive them from a short distance and send them to a network.
Kaito
But if you somehow can't use your chip to communicate with it, you can hold its hand and…
Yonagi
Hold?! Me? I-I have to hold its... its appendages?
Kaito
And the bits protruding from its head are horn-shaped antennas.
Yonagi
Those two little sad hairs growing out of its bald head?!
Kaito
They're not hairs, they're horns.
Yonagi
And what's going on in its rear? Is that... a tail? Oh, for the love of...
Kaito
It's a tail, but it's main purpose is to act as a propeller.
Yonagi
A propeller?!

I smile and nod.
Kaito
Yeah, that's the great part about it.
Kaito
It flies!
Yonagi
Oh hell no... Please tell me it ain't so...
Kaito
Of course, it's not just the little propeller lifting it up.
Yonagi
That's not what I meant!
Kaito
I just thought it'd be cuter if its propeller spins as it hovers along.
Yonagi
Cute... What part of this is cute...?
Kaito
It would be an auxiliary device for Izumo, so it would always be hovering behind her.
Yonagi
This thing?! All the time?! In OUR house?!

I nod proudly.
Kaito
It know that sounds unbelievable, but it's okay. It can charge itself automatically, so it can stay floating indefinitely.
Yonagi
That's not what I'm worried about!
Yonagi
Wait a second now! Are you seriously telling me that this...
Yonagi
This is your vision?!
Yonagi
We're supposed to live together like this from now on?!
Yonagi
You think this is cute?!
Kaito
Well, yes.
Yonagi
I won't stand for this!

When we come out of the dreamscape, Yonagi looks at the end of her rope.
Yonagi
What did I ever do to deserve this...
Kaito
I told you, it's supposed to be a dream sheep, so I—
Yonagi
Don't you dare!

Yonagi snatches my sketch and draws something next to it.
Yonagi
This is what a sheep looks like!
Izumo
Sheep recognized.
Yonagi
Finally, some sanity!
Kaito
I give you that it also looks like a sheep.
Yonagi
This is LITERALLY the only thing on this paper that looks like a sheep!
Kaito
But that's just a sheep.
Yonagi
As for what cute looks like...!
Yonagi
It's more like... like this!
Kaito
...
Izumo
Ooh!
Kaito
But I...
Yonagi
No buts, you butthead!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
It's a sheep and a robot, right? If it's supposed to fly behind Izumo...

Yonagi glances over at Izumo and puts the pen to her lips.
Yonagi
Maybe it could be white and have blue glowing accents on it?
Yonagi
Do it like this, or else.
Kaito
Uh? Are you sure? It feels kind of...
Kaito
Plain?
Yonagi
Better than staring at insanity floating in our house every day!
Izumo
I concur.
Kaito
Oh...
Yonagi
What? Why are you sad about it?
Kaito
Well...
Kaito
Maybe drawing wasn't my best idea...
Yonagi
Realizing you have a problem is the first step, sweetie. Well done.

It's been a few days since my confidence as an artist was absolutely crushed.

While I'm still not happy with how things turned out, I have come to realize that Yonagi's design might have some advantages over mine.

After much discussion, we decide on the design of Izumo's auxiliary unit.

And I had to reorganize its internal structure accordingly to make it work.

I print out the exterior, then put in the base for the lab's virtual simulator as well as the communication devices.
Kaito
Okay. Izumo, scan your auxiliary unit.
Izumo
An open connection has been found.
Kaito
Can you connect to it?
Izumo
Connection successful.
Kaito
Cool.
Support Terminal
*Chirp*

It makes the sound just like I hoped it would.

The nature of the sound is a deliberate choice on my part.

I can't wait for Yonagi to hear it.
Yonagi
I'm back, Izumo—Kaito?!
Kaito
Welcome home.
Yonagi
It's so rare to see you home first!
Kaito
I've been working here since noon.
Yonagi
Really? What have you been doing?
Kaito
This.

I move one step to the right, revealing Izumo and...
Yonagi
Ah!

Yonagi's eyes glimmer when she catches sight of the floating auxiliary unit.
Yonagi
That's super! You finished it?
Kaito
Yeah. Everything inside of it is pretty much stuff I re-used from elsewhere. Professor Asuma said I could use it all.
Yonagi
Whoa!
Support Terminal
*Chirp*
Yonagi
Ah! It spoke!
Kaito
Not its most useful feature, I admit.

I say, the corners of my mouth rising into a shy little smile.
Kaito
But I think it's a meaningful feature for the both of us, maybe.
Yonagi
For us?
Support Terminal
*Chirp*
Yonagi
Wait...
Kaito
Can you tell what sound that is?
Yonagi
...
Support Terminal
*Chirp*
Kaito
...
Yonagi
The bird? The one we found in that middle side cave?
Kaito
Bingo.
Kaito
I found the chirps of the same kind of bird in the sound database, so I incorporated them into it.
Kaito
It's set to chirp every time it finishes processing something.
Yonagi
Kaito, give it a name.
Kaito
A name?

She smiled and nods.
Yonagi
It needs a name!
Kaito
...
Yonagi
We should have given Mr. Birdie a real name.
Yonagi
Not just 'Mr. Birdie'... It would have been nice if we'd thought up a proper name for him...
Kaito
Yeah, you're right.

Yonagi beams at me and nods.
Yonagi
You name it!
Kaito
M-Me? But you designed it.

She nods again.
Yonagi
That's why! If I design it, and you name it, I think we'll love it like it's our own little baby.
Kaito
Our... baby?
Yonagi
Yeah!
Kaito
...

Of course, I'd considered the possibility we might have a child someday.

Our child...

If that time ever comes…

I want it to be when we're living happily in the middle side.
Yonagi
Have any names in mind?
Kaito
Uh? W-Well, yeah.
Kaito
When I tried designing it, I was thinking of the dreamscape, of sleep, and of dreams. That's why I went with a sheep motif.
Yonagi
So something relating to the design.
Kaito
Real sheep have wool, and resting your head on wool helps sleep...
Yonagi
I see. How about we call it Wooleep, then?

I shake my head.
Kaito
No, we call HIM Wooleep.
Yonagi
Oh, he's a boy?

I nod.
Yonagi
The pronoun matters that much?
Kaito
Of course. We don't call Izumo 'it,' do we? Besides, it's cuter that way.
Yonagi
Really?

I nod enthusiastically.
Kaito
Call him Wooleep. Are you okay with that, Izumo?
Izumo
I will act accordingly to his creator's wishes.
Yonagi
Well, I suppose that's fine. Nice to meet you, little guy. We're family now!
Shleep
*Chirp*

Perhaps I was wrong to think of it as a meaningless feature.

Strangely enough, simply hearing that little noise coming back in response is enough to make me feel a sense of attachment towards the robot.
Kaito
Okay, now...
Yonagi
Huh?
Kaito
Let's make sure Wooleep is functioning correctly.

Her eyes light up as she realizes what I mean by that.
Yonagi
You'll be able to talk now?!
Kaito
Maybe, if all goes according to plan.
Yonagi
It's gonna be amazing! Let's try!
Izumo
Before that...

Yonagi and I turn to Izumo.
Izumo
I will prepare porridge.

She declares, before walking over to the kitchen.
Shleep
*Chirp*

Wooleep lets out a sonorous chirp before chasing after Izumo.
Yonagi
It looks like Izumo's fond of him too.
Kaito
I hope she is.

And then, after dinner...

We go into the dreamscape.
Yonagi
Kaito?
Kaito
A-Ah...

My voice spreads throughout the dreamscape.
Yonagi
*Gasp*!
Kaito
Can you hear me?
Yonagi
I can hear you! I can't believe it! You're talking!
Kaito
Finally.

I finally found a way.

I've studied for so long in order to make this happen.
Yonagi
It's incredible! We can finally talk in here!
Kaito
Now...

We need to make sure scent and sound behave as they should in this space.

But before that...
Kaito
Yonagi.
Yonagi
...

She looks up at me, waiting for the words.
Kaito
Let's go see Mom.
Yonagi
Yes!

We go to our house within the dreamscape.

When we arrive, Mom's on her bed.

Then she slowly turns towards us.

Just like she always did.

I glance at Yonagi.

She returns my gaze and smiles.

Her support encourages me, and I approach the bed.
Kaito
Mom.

It feels surreal to finally be hearing my own voice in this space.

Mom slowly turns her face up to me.

She's wearing that same gentle smile she always had for us.
Mom
Kaito, Yonagi.

Her voice stuns me for a brief moment.
Kaito
Mom...
Kaito
Yonagi and I... We're doing well.
Kaito
We're living together now.
Yonagi
With Izumo and Wooleep too!

Mom's smile widens as she looks up at us.
Mom
I see!
Mom
I'm glad to hear that, sweetie.
Kaito
...

We come face to face for the first time in years, and we exchange words.

My conviction that this technology will save humankind only grows stronger.

Using this, everyone in the city will be able to experience life on the surface with their loved ones.

Reality is what we make of it, and this is reality.

There will be no lowsiders, no midsiders, no topsiders.

Everyone will be the same under the light of the sun, free from discrimination or hate.
Kaito
This feeling...

Everything up to this point...

All those years reading and imagining a better life...

All the theorizing and testing...

Every thing up to this day has finally come together to make it possible.

Is this swelling emotion within my chest... what accomplishment feels like?

A sudden warmth spreads across my body.I can feel it, without a shadow of a doubt.
