Rin
...I'm sorry for making you come here. I just couldn't stay in that place any longer.
Arishima
It's fine, don't worry about it.

Overcome with emotion, she opened up to me in her dad's studio.

While I processed it, she asked to leave the room, so we did.

After that, she brought me to her apartment. It was a short walk, just like she said.

The place she's living in is pretty huge.

All the furniture feels really fancy.

It's probably expensive.

Rin sets up two teacups side by side on the table and sits facing me.
Rin
There were talks with the publisher he was working with, and they decided to hide the true cause of death from the public.
Rin
I heard about it from my father's personal assistant.
Rin
If he was the kind of author who wrote decadent, literary pieces, maybe they would have made his suicide known.
Arishima
...

Dazai Osamu, Akutagawa Ryunosuke, Kawabata Yasunari...

The list of literary masters that choose to take their lives isn't exactly short.
Rin
The most popular of my father's works are probably the ones that end on an uplifting note.

I nod.

The corners of her mouth twist into a little sarcastic smile.
Rin
It's funny, isn't it?
Arishima
How so?
Rin
Even in death, he keeps on lying to all his readers. Not that he's aware of it now.
Arishima
...
Rin
It doesn't have anything to do with him anymore.

After that, the silence extends for a while.

There's not even the ticking of a clock in this room to break the stillness.

The hands of the wall clock glide across the surface soundlessly.

I watch it go by for a while.
Rin
Here...

As soon as Rin speaks, my head snaps back to her.
Rin
I'd like you to have this.

She places a key on the table.
Arishima
...It's for the studio?

Rin nods.
Rin
You don't have to take it, if you don't want to. I'll leave the choice up to you.

I stare down at the key.

It's a rectangular key with round dents along its length.
Arishima
Uh, what do you want me to do?
Arishima
Is there something you want from me?

When I raise my gaze, our eyes meet.
Arishima
You want me to learn what he was really like as person, so I can depict him properly and you can better understand him? Is that it?

Still with her eyes on me, she speaks slowly.
Rin
I want you to save me.
Arishima
...
Rin
I don't want you to follow after my father's footsteps.
Rin
Coming into contact with my father's real voice may help, and it may also help you find what it is you really need to write.
Arishima
...And that would save you?
Rin
Maybe.
Rin
If you choose a different path to the one he did, that may save me.
Arishima
...

I ponder upon her words.

Since she thinks her father and I are alike, she also thinks she can save me by intervening and preventing me from turning out like him.

She sees someone close to her, on his way to ruin in her eyes, who could gain something from her actions.

And that would be the salvation she's looking for?

While I think upon her words, she remains silent.

She simply stares at me, almost completely still.
Arishima
...You think too much of me. Your dad and I couldn't be more different.
Arishima
Your dad's writing was so exceptional that he killed himself over it.
Arishima
My words don't have that power.
Arishima
You read them. You should know.
Rin
And you think too little of yourself.
Rin
Besides, weren't you the one who told me not to ignore what my heart tells me?
Arishima
...
Rin
Anyone's writing has the power to hurt others.
Rin
Maybe your spirit was killed off by your writing already.
Arishima
Wha...

That expression...

That actually does sound like me, strangely enough.
Arishima
Then that's even more proof that I can't go off like your dad.
Rin
You can still crawl back from the edge. I'm sure you can.
Arishima
...
Rin
Whether you revise the novel you already wrote or decide to write a completely new one, I don't think anything in that office will disturb your work.
Arishima
...

I'd be lying if I said I'm not interested.

He's the person I've been looking up to for years.

The one person that embodied all of my ideals.

All that creative material that always seemed wrapped up by a thick veil is there.

The world at large doesn't even know his real cause of death.

They believe in the lie that his editors and publishing house put out.

Rin been chasing after her father for so long...

And she said that none of his books truly reflect his mind.

But that mind, that particular scent of the author, is hanging over that studio.

It's almost choking in its intensity.

I...

Will I be consumed by it?

Will I be able to see his true self and stay as I am?
Rin
I'll give you the key, but it's up to you whether to use it or not.

I lower my gaze to the key again.
Arishima
Okay. I'll take it.
Rin
Okay.
Arishima
But I won't go over there unannounced. That's a bit much.
Rin
It doesn't matter. No one goes there anymore.

I shake my head.
Arishima
I'll let you know whenever I go in or out.

I take out my smartphone.
Rin
Wait a moment.

She leaves her seat and comes back with after a moment with her own phone.
Rin
I always leave it in my bag.

I nod.

We exchange contact information on a popular messaging app.

"Hello."

I send the first message.

And she responds with a "Hi."
Arishima
I'll drop by after this. Is there anything you don't want me to do that room?

She thinks for a moment.
Rin
...There's lots of paper in there.

I nod.
Arishima
I'll be careful not to start a fire.
Rin
There's an ashtray in the kitchen. You can smoke there.

I let out a dry chuckle.

Looks like I'm destined to smoke in kitchens wherever I am.
Arishima
I'll message you again when I'm leaving.

She nods.
Rin
And then you'll... go home?
Arishima
Huh?

I think on that question for a moment.
Rin
Oh, never mind. Forget I said that.

When I nod, she smiles again.

I walk from Rin's apartment back to Shuho's studio alone.

What will I find there?

I remember the notebook Rin gave me.

I've unleashed the same kind of unstoppable, visercal anger on the page before too.

The notebook ends up torn, and the mechanical pencil used on it bent.

But the anger doesn't go away; it never does.

Of course it doesn't.

Because the thing causing the anger is your own self.

It's not the kind of anger you can quell by breaking things.

But you just can't help yourself. The need to vent is too great.

I've had that kind of moment before.

When she handed me that notebook, it felt like I was getting my own notebook returned to me.

It feels like she's seeing right through me. Seeing me for the small, pathetic man that I am.

I look up and see the condominium complex ahead.

Can I really face up to Hatano Shuho?

I step into the confined room once again.

This is where he died, alone.

Now that I'm aware of that fact, the air in this room somehow feels heavier than before.

There's a thick layer of dust covering most of the stuff in it.

I simply sit down on the floor in the middle of it and take it all in.

I notice a pile of paper nearby and reach out to it.

There are bundles of newspapers from years past.

Writing left behind by the deceased.

Things that weren't meant to be read by anyone.

Is it morally okay for me to read them?

I still have my doubts.

I can't bear the idea of someone digging up my notebooks after my death.

Did he even think about that when he took his life?

What would I have done?

If I was going to die...
Arishima
...

In a way, I suppose the fear of people going through my stuff or seeing what I wrote would keep me from ending my life.

But perhaps a person with serious suicidal thoughts wouldn't worry about what others might see or say about him after the fact.

It has nothing to do with honor. Not at all like a samurai's death by seppuku.

I ponder my own death.

As for where...

I can only think of my own room.

That's the only place where I feel alone and at peace.

If I was about to end my life, I would definitely erase all the data from my laptop.
Arishima
...

Memories of last night come rushing in.

I remember my wife's voice as I forced myself upon her.

It had been well over a decade since I had any physical contact with her.

Maybe even before these already yellowed old newspapers were published.

What will happen to us now?

How will we keep living in that house?

Or perhaps I'm asking the wrong question. How will we part ways?

Whatever the outcome, the one thing I'm certain of is that there is no bright future ahead of me.

Perhaps...

My best option is to stay here forever.

I hug my knees to my chest and rest my forehead on them before closing my eyes.

It's quiet in here.

The air is loaded and heavy.

The thick air swirls around me like the flowing water.

It feels like being at the bottom of a riverbed.

Not the kind that goes downstream to meet with the sea.

But the bottom of a dark, cold, stale lake.

Hah...

Isn't it perfect?

What else does a piece of trash like me deserve?

I see now. Rin must have known this whole time.

She must have known that I needed this place.

She must have realized.
Arishima
...

My breathing slowly evens out.

I take deep, relaxed breaths.

The terror I felt when I first stepped in here is gone.

What was I even afraid of?

In here, I don't need to fear the outside world.

I sleep a dreamless sleep.

How long have I been here?

The sunlight doesn't touch this room.

This might be a great place to focus entirely on one's work, but I can't forget about the world beyond.

Not yet, at least.

I take out my smartphone and look at the time.
Arishima
Morning, huh?

It's about time for the first bus of the day to depart.

I sigh.

It's time to go to work again.

I raise my weary body.

After that, I send a message to Rin.

"I'm leaving the room."

She reads it just a few seconds after I send it.

"Okay," she answers.

Her reply is immediate.

It's still about five in the morning.

For a moment, I wonder if she was waiting to hear from me, but then I get over myself and drop the idea.

Maybe the notification woke her up.

I put away my phone without replying.

The sun feels dazzling as I step outside.

We're already in the middle of summer.

The semester will be over soon.

Step by step, I walk toward my everyday routine.

What will my wife and I say to one another next time we meet?

Will I see contempt in her face, or just plain hatred?

Do I have to go back to that home knowing there is no hope?

I felt strangely at peace in Shuho's study.

But even that's fading now.

I take the key out of my pocket.

I stare at it as it sits on the palm of my hand.

What will my life become from now on?

My life...

Is it worth living, even?

I arrive home before the clock hits six.

The roads are empty this early, and there weren't many people riding the first bus of the day.

When I open the front door...

I see my wife's suitcase by the entrance.

I look down at it for a moment.

Hearing the living room door open, I raise my gaze and see my wife, her expression a mask of surprise.
Shouko
Why are you here?
Arishima
...

I'm a little baffled by the question.

This is my house too.
Shouko
...I thought you were sleeping in your room.
Arishima
...

The first thing I notice from her tone is that she's deeply fed up.
Arishima
You're leaving?

She lets out a huge, exasperated sigh.

It's half fatigue, half annoyance, and all hate.
Shouko
I can't sleep in the same house as you anymore, can I?
Arishima
...

I stand there at the entrance, looking dazedly in her direction.

She swiftly puts on her shoes and extends the handle of the suitcase.
Shouko
Bye.

She passes by me, her stride strong and swift.
Arishima
...Shouko.

I call out to her from behind.

She turns around and shoots me an icy glare, her expression nothing but open disgust.
Arishima
...Just tell me one last thing.
Shouko
...
Arishima
That day when we met for the first time. Why did you decide to talk to me instead of Shuho?

She squints her eyes and looks at me suspiciously.
Arishima
He's the one who won the award. We were at his party.
Arishima
That's the first time you ever spoke to me.

She stares at me without saying a word.
Arishima
At least tell me that. That's all I want.

She lets out a small sigh.
Shouko
Could you quit trying to turn everything into a story?

Her eyes brim with contempt.
Arishima
Story?
Shouko
Because I felt something in your writing. Something that could surpass Hatano in the future.
Shouko
That's what you want me to say, right?
Shouko
You want to be the protagonist of that story, right?
Arishima
...

I simply stare at her without answering.
Shouko
I just didn't want to be part of the crowd swarming him that night.

Her words carry a tinge of self-derision.
Shouko
But you know how that feels as well as I do, right?
Shouko
I just couldn't stomach being one more face in the crowd, but it's not like I had anything exceptional in me to stand out.
Shouko
Wasn't that the same for us both?

I'm unable to answer.

A long silence falls between us.
Shouko
I'm not a small supporting role in your life. I'm not here to liven up your background like a cute little wallflower.
Arishima
...I know that.
Shouko
You don't. You treat people like objects because you don't understand.
Arishima
...
Shouko
You violated and trampled on me.

Her tone is flat.
Shouko
Don't you ever forget it.
Shouko
Know that you have done the lowest thing a person could do.
Shouko
I don't want to see your face or hear your voice ever again. Just being around you makes me feel dirty.
Shouko
Just let me go already...

I can feel the pure, undiluted hatred in her words clawing at me.
Arishima
...Sorry.

I stare down at her feet as I say it.

There's no love lost between us.

And yet, I'm unable to face that deep hatred.

...She's right.

I forced myself on her that night because I'm weak, and I'm trash.
Shouko
From now on, I don't want to talk to you directly.

I don't look up.
Shouko
I don't need your apologies. Your words don't mean anything to me anymore.
Arishima
...

She turns away for the last time, and the front door closes behind her.

I hear the faint sound of the suitcase wheels rolling away.

Soon, not even that remains.

"Your words don't mean anything to me anymore."

I know that those words will be the last I ever hear from her.

At last, I raise my face.

I can't help but smile at a sudden realization.

That room...

Now I know why I felt so comfortable in Shuho's room.

The air in this house is also heavy.

This place is just like that studio.

I'm used to this oppressive atmosphere.

But it's over now.

My life, that is.

The married life we lived for 21 years.

...I destroyed it.

I turn on the extractor fan in the kitchen and take out a cig under it.

I stare vacantly as the smoke I exhale is sucked into it.

As I watch the swirling tendrils, I realize that I don't have to smoke in a corner like this anymore.

There's no one to complain if I put out my cigs on the floor instead of in an ashtray.

I'm the only one in this house now. There is no one else.

It's almost unreal.

25 years of ties.

21 years of marriage.

All over.

What the hell did I... did we build in our 25 years together? What was it all for?

We didn't build anything. We just went through the motions.

Get a job, get married, buy a house...

I kept on treasuring those empty moments, pretending like I was protecting something important in our lives.

That was true for both me and my wife. Our time together was of no value to either of us.

Why did we spend so many years faking being a family?

I've finally begun losing my connections to this world.

Not just at the academy, but as a member of society as well.

There's no world for disgusting old men like me out there.

I keep looking up to the fan as it rotates.

But despite everything, I know I'll still go to work when it's time.

And I'll keep teaching those lessons no one needs.

Am I keeping up appearances, or is it my work ethic?

I don't even know what's left in me anymore.
Arishima
As such, a piece comprising mainly of waka poems is called an 'uta monogatari'...

In the end, I came here.

I've never been absent from work.

And I don't think it'll ever happen.

I spent the last night in a place where a person died and broke up with the person I've lived with for a quarter of a century the morning after.

And then, I came here to give a lecture I don't give a crap about.

What the hell am I even doing here?

What am I trying to protect?

I don't know.

Who am I here for?

Who even wants me to be here?

My mind is a complete mess, but I can still keep writing and spouting the usual emotionless lecture like clockwork.

If I keep going through the motions, perhaps I'll end up not feeling anything.

I give the students a task, sit down, and turn my gaze to Rin.

As usual, she's looking out the window.

Her expression seems ephemeral and lifeless, like a statue.

I stare at her for a while.

I know this is not her place.

And chances are that she knows my place isn't here either.

Yet our legs still carry us both here, where we sit and simply let time go by.

We hold our breath together in the classroom, telling no one about how we met in her house yesterday.

It's like we're hiding a huge secret.

Infiltrating this normal world while we live in another, hidden one.

I follow her gaze out the window.

What is she looking at right now?

If possible...

I don't want to see the limp, pathetic thing I become in this classroom reflected in her eyes.

After I'm done with lectures for the morning, I head straight to the smoking area.

I don't feel like having lunch today.

I just stare at the smoke rising from my cigarette.
Watanabe
Hey there.

Raising my head, I see Watanabe.

He's looking down at me, a tense smile marking his face.
Watanabe
Hey...

Watanabe's voice lowers to a whisper as he takes out a cig and lights it up.
Watanabe
Feel like talking? Not a good moment?
Arishima
...

I just shake my head.
Arishima
I don't know.
Watanabe
Geez, what's going on with your life, man?! It's like I'm watching a soap opera in real life.
Arishima
Hahahah...

Watanabe still looks tense, and my laughter doesn't seem to help.
Arishima
Like a soap opera, huh? Guess I chose a bad time for it, because I'm tired as hell.
Watanabe
Seriously, what happened?
Arishima
...I'll tell you when things have calmed down.
Watanabe
You sure you're okay?
Arishima
...Good question.
Watanabe
At least lie and say you're fine, geez.
Arishima
...I came to work. I'm still fine enough.
Watanabe
Still being the operative word, huh?

I lower my gaze to the floor, fixing it on nothing in particular.

We spend the rest of the time in silence, and before long lunch break is over.

After I'm done with work for the day, my legs take me back to Shuho's studio.

"I'm heading to the studio again," I write to Rin.

Again, she reads it almost immediately.

"Okay," she answers.

I'm a little surprised by the swiftness of her response.

Even when I was living with my wife, the house was always empty when I got home.

I was often alone until it was time to go to bed.

Her moving out won't change much.

Except that now the silence in the house feels different.

I thought the relationship between us was already cold and dead.

But I've done nothing but think about our marriage today.

Or maybe... I'm just pretending to think about it?

My thoughts feel scattered and blurry.

My encounter with my wife.

The encounter with Rin.

My rekindled urge to create.

Coming face-to-face with Shuho's death.

My mind just keeps circling around the same thoughts.

Before I know it, I'm already in front of the complex.

I take a deep breath.

The stagnant air fills my lungs.

It's strangely comforting.

I fee like I've adapted to this space.

I'm at ease here.

I feel like I can be myself.

I walk to the center of the room and touch Shuho's desk.

The power strip that gives power to the lamp is unplugged from the outlet.

I pick it up, plug it in, and turn on the light.

Warm light immediately breathes life into the room.

I slowly pull out the chair and sit down.

I place both hands on the desk.

I can't help but laugh at myself. I'm acting like some earnest literature student visiting a museum with a reproduction of the desk used by a literary master.

So this is where Shuho wrote his novels?

The laptop is connected and charged.

After thinking it over for a moment, I turn it on.

The screen lights up.

Within seconds, I'm blocked by the login screen.

Of course.

Even I set a password for my laptop.

I turn off the laptop.

Looking back over my shoulder, I reach for one of the many notebooks stacked nearby.

I recall the page spread that Rin showed me yesterday.

Will this one be full of hateful writing, just like the last?

Squinting in the dim light, I open the book.

Neat and proper handwriting fits in the quarter-inch space between the lines.
Arishima
A diary?

"Everything's wrong. Every single thing. Slowly but surely, my reality loses life, vitality."

"First it was the heat. The heat in my mind slowly died out."

"Just as a corpse cools down, my soul's heat disappeared, never to return."

"There's not even an ember left in me anymore."

"All I can do is watch as my heart slowly dies."

"The next thing that went was sound."

"And lastly, even the color left me. Everything is now a blanket of gray in my eyes."

"A lifeless shell of a world without warmth, sound, or color."

"The only thing I feel is an unquenchable thirst."

What is this?

If I could see my face right now, I'm sure my eyes would be glimmering.

I cover the smile forming at the corners of my mouth with my hand.

A small, choked chuckle escapes my lips.
Arishima
It's the same...

Who would have thought that here in this place...

I would find a soul I sympathize with from the bottom of my heart.

I understand all that he writes here.

The frustration, the lethargy.

The despair and hopelessness that keep you paralyzed.
Arishima
I get it, Shuho...

It was here all along.

A person just like me.

Would he have been able to truly understand me?

No...

I could have understood him as well.

I turn the pages in a daze.

It's the first time since junior high that I've been this entranced over words that haven't been typed and printed onto paper.

Forgetting myself entirely, I keep reading his diary.

I follow Shuho's daily life, sometimes laughing with him and sometimes frustrated by the shallow people around him.

It feels like I'm working together with him as a fellow writer.

I can feel the true Shuho coming through in this writing.

Or rather, it's precisely because he's not trying to write anything that his being emerges from these pages.

When I close the notebook and stare at the cover for a moment, my phone vibrates in my pocket.

It's a message from Rin.

"Are you still in my father's studio?" she asks.

A short, to-the-point question.

I think for a second then reply.

"Yes. I'm about to leave."

It's marked as read within seconds.

The message that indicates she's writing something appears.

I wait for her reply.

Immediately after the backlight dims, my phone vibrates again.

"Would you like to have dinner together?" she writes.

I stare at the message for a moment.

I think for longer than the time it took her to reply.

I want to tell Rin about what I learned of her dad today.

That's what I'm here for.

Us eating together won't harm or do wrong by anyone.

The only people who would reproach us for spending time together are the small minded and self-righteous.

"Yeah, that'd be nice," I answer.

I press send.

She reads the message and sends an answer.

"Thank you."

"I'll be there in 15 minutes."

I reply with an "Ok" then stow the phone back into my pocket.

There are more of Shuho's diaries piled up.

Maybe I should take the next one with me?

After thinking it over, I decide I shouldn't take anything that's in here outside.

This is a sanctuary.

If I don't read them here in this space, something will be lost.

With a little reluctance, I leave the studio, and everything in it, behind.

When I get off the elevator and step outside, I see Rin waiting for me by the entrance.

It hasn't even been five minutes since she sent the last message.

I hurry over to her.

Noticing me, she bows in greeting.
Arishima
Hey.

A little unsure on how to greet her back, I default to a lame salute.

But I guess it isn't that bad, judging from the way she smiles.
Rin
Aren't you tired? You were there all night.
Arishima
Yeah, I'm fine. I slept for a while.

She seems surprised.
Rin
In that room?

I nod sheepishly.
Arishima
Sitting on the floor, actually.
Rin
I see...
Arishima
So, where are we going? A diner would be fine by me.
Rin
There are a few around here. We should probably go to one a little further afield, right?
Rin
There might be other students around here.
Arishima
Yeah... Right.

I didn't even think of that. I feel a little inadequate as I nod.
Arishima
Let's do that.
Rin
Okay.

We walk to the bus stop together.

She takes me to a cafe.

The place looks pretty snazzy, and most of the tables are filled with younger people.

I'm the only middle-aged person.

We sit facing each other at a small table.

Rin orders spaghetti and I a beef curry.

After the person taking our order leaves, Rin stares at me like she has something to say.
Rin
Umm...
Arishima
Yeah?
Rin
Do you ever eat anything other than curry?
Arishima
Huh?

She looks at me, clearly curious.
Rin
It's all I see you eating in the cafeteria.
Arishima
Oh... I guess you're right.

I let out a small laugh.
Arishima
If there's curry on offer, that's what I tend to go for. Guess I like it well enough.
Rin
Don't you get tired of having the same thing every day?
Arishima
Not really.

Her eyes widen in surprise.
Rin
You like curry that much? I did see you having soba one day, though.
Arishima
I was nursing a hangover that day. I'd gone drinking with a colleague the night before.
Rin
Heheh.

A little laugh escapes her lips.
Rin
So you hang out with other teachers, then?
Arishima
Only Watanabe. You know, from social studies.
Rin
The young guy? You must get along well.

I nod.
Arishima
He's the only one I would call a friend.
Rin
The only one? I see.

Those words seem to make her think for a moment.
Rin
Am I maybe bothering you with this?

Rin asks as she reaches for her water glass on the table.
Arishima
What?
Rin
It just occurred to me that your wife might have cooked dinner for you back home.
Arishima
Oh...

That takes a dry chuckle out of me.
Arishima
Don't worry. I always have dinner alone. It's no bother.
Rin
Is that so?
Arishima
How about you?

She cocks her head in slight confusion.
Arishima
You come here often?

She shakes her head.
Rin
Sometimes, on the weekends. It's the first time I've come here in the evening though.
Arishima
You eat out a lot?
Rin
I cook sometimes, but I buy takeout more often. Boxed lunches and stuff like that.
Rin
What about you? Do you and your wife go out to eat a lot?

I see her face in my mind's eye again.
Arishima
...I suppose. At least I do.
Arishima
I often just grab something while I'm out and take it home. My microwave sees a lot of use.

There's that look again, like she has something she wants to say.
Arishima
What is it?
Rin
Oh, nothing...

Rin stares at her glass of water for a moment before speaking up.
Rin
I was just wondering... why are you and your wife together at all?
Arishima
...

Every time she says the word wife, it feels wrong.

She's no longer my wife.

We're separated in every sense of the word, except legally.

And I'm sure the paperwork will reach me soon enough.
Arishima
That's a good question.
Rin
Um...

Rin's voice is almost a whisper.

I snap back from my thoughts and turn to her.

She's staring down at her glass of water again.
Arishima
Yeah?
Rin
Do you have children?
Arishima
As in, children of my own?

Rin nods.
Arishima
Why do you ask?
Rin
Uh, it's just that...

I half listen as she stumbles over her words for a while.
Rin
I just thought that maybe you're staying together because you have children.
Rin
I just wondered if that was the case.
Arishima
Huh, guess that makes sense.

When I say that, she turns her eyes up to me.
Arishima
I wouldn't know. Don't have any kids.
Rin
Oh, really?
Arishima
I do see how having a kid would be reason enough to make a couple stick together, at least until they're grown up.
Arishima
I've never been in that position, though, so I wouldn't know.
Arishima
Besides, some parents give more weight to their own situation than their kids'.
Rin
...Right.

The silence lingers for a moment before the waiter comes with our orders of beef curry for me and roe spaghetti for her.
Rin
Shall we eat?

I nod and pick up my spoon.
Rin
It looks delicious.

Rin murmurs as she neatly wraps the spaghetti around her fork and brings it to her mouth.

I do the same with my curry.

It's a little spicier than what they serve at the campus cafeteria, but it goes down easy.
Arishima
This is pretty good.
Rin
I'm glad you like it.

Rin smiles at me.
Rin
Did you learn anything?

After eating for a while, she asks me a question.
Rin
In the studio, I mean.
Arishima
Yeah.

I swallow and nod.
Arishima
I did.

Rin stares right at me.
Arishima
I read your dad's diary.
Rin
A diary? From when?
Arishima
The autumn of the year before he passed.
Arishima
There was none of the erratic writing that you showed me before. Do you want to read it too?

She takes a moment, then shakes her head.
Rin
I don't need to.
Arishima
...

It's strange.
Arishima
Why not?

She raises her gaze to me again.
Arishima
You said you wanted to know about him.
Arishima
You're even reading his novels, right?
Arishima
So why don't you want to read what he wrote in his diary?
Rin
...
Arishima
I feel like you could get so much more out of reading his diary than the stuff he published.

Rin stays silent for a moment.
Rin
My father never wanted to get married.
Arishima
Uh, really?

I repeat what she just said in my head.
Arishima
What do you mean?

Rin slowly lowers her fork and places it back on the table.
Rin
I've read some of what's in that room too.
Rin
He always resented my mother. He regretted his marriage every day.
Arishima
...

She looks down again, and her eyes wander about the table.
Rin
I was the reason they even got married in the first place.
Arishima
I see.

So it was a one night stand accident.

Things start to make sense.

Maybe that's why she asked if I had any kids.
Rin
Maybe I'm too much of a coward.

Rin said the same thing at the library before.

I suppose the dead can't talk back, no matter how much we might want them to.
Rin
...I don't really have any particular attachment to my mother after she abandoned us both either.
Rin
That's why... I don't want to read about him regretting my existence.
Rin
My life never had any value from the outset... from before I was even born.
Rin
Even if that's the truth, I didn't want to know about it.
Arishima
I don't think that's quite right.

She raises her face to look at me again.

I notice her eyes starting to water.

I return her gaze.
Arishima
Even if your mom abandoned you, or if your dad regretted his marriage.
Arishima
That has nothing to do with your value. Parents don't have the right to determine their child's worth. You're you, and no one can take that away.
Arishima
No one's birth certificate comes with a price tag for their life's value. You're not worthless.

She stares at me, stunned.
Arishima
For example, I'm having a good time during dinner for the first time in months. And it's thanks to you.
Arishima
Maybe... You are saving me far more than you think.
Rin
You're having a good time right now?

I nod.
Arishima
This is way more fun than eating dinner alone in an empty house.

She lets out a little chuckle.
Rin
We're not exactly having the most lighthearted conversation, you know?
Arishima
Bragging about who has the biggest misfortune can be entertaining when the company's good.

She seems a little miffed at that last remark.
Rin
I'm not bragging.
Arishima
I know, it's just a figure of speech.

She takes a deep breath and smiles.

Sometimes, she looks way more mature than I give her credit for.
Rin
Then tell me about your misfortune too. We're in good company, right?
Arishima
I'm a middle-aged teacher who has done nothing of worth in his life. You want me to add more stuff on top of that?
Arishima
I'm just as I seem. A walking billboard of misery.
Rin
But you're here having dinner with one of your students.
Rin
Doesn't that offset your misfortune a little?

For a moment, I see her bright rose eyes sparkle.
Arishima
...Maybe.
Arishima
I do feel like we have some strange connection. And I think I'm really lucky to have met someone like you by pure coincidence.
Arishima
The conditions in which we grew up are kinda similar. I've never thought much of my father. Heck, I didn't even know what he looked like.

Her eyes widen in surprise.
Rin
Oh, really?
Arishima
I remember thinking what you're thinking now a lot when I was young.
Rin
You did?
Arishima
I felt like I was denied value as a person for a long time.
Rin
But because you once felt that way, your words speak to me today.

I nod.
Arishima
Exactly. Life has a way of setting things right.

Rin's smile looks genuinely bright for once.
Rin
I thought we were talking about misfortune here, but you don't look unhappy at all. What happened to the billboard of misery thing?

I shake my head with a silly smirk on my face.
Arishima
My wife left me this morning. I'm at rock bottom.

The smile face slowly fades from Rin's face.
Rin
Is that true?

I nod.
Rin
But why?
Arishima
It's my fault, I suppose. Scratch the suppose. It's all on me.

She stares at me in silence for a while.
Arishima
We both deceived each other, and we never really lived as a couple during all these years.
Arishima
All we did was pass the time pretending like we were husband and wife.
Arishima
At least for that, I think we both share the blame.

I can feel her gaze on me.

I take a sip of water to try and quench my thirst a little.
Arishima
But it's my fault in the end. I make no excuses.

I see the line of her mouth turn into a frown.
Rin
Are you sure you shouldn't go after her?
Arishima
Nah. Neither of us feel anything for the other at this point. There's only divorce paperwork to do now, nothing else.

She looks down again and is silent for a moment.
Rin
I'm sorry for dragging you out today of all days...

I shake my head.
Arishima
No, you've helped me a lot. I needed it, especially today.
Arishima
I'm sorry for bringing it up. I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.
Rin
No, I'm glad you told me about it.
Rin
I invited you out because I want to know more about you.
Rin
But I had no idea...

She trails off and remains quiet for a bit.
Rin
Was it because you stayed at my father's studio? She got mad because you didn't tell her you'd be out?

I shake my head again.
Arishima
Don't worry, that has nothing to do with it.

She looks at me, clearly anxious.
Arishima
...Someday, if I ever feel like talking about, I may tell you.
Arishima
I don't really feel like talking with anyone about it right now.

She calmly nods.
Rin
...I'll wait.

After finishing the beef curry, I order some coffee from the waiter that comes pick up the dishes.
Arishima
You want some too?

Still chewing on the last of her spaghetti, she nods.

The waiter bows and leaves with a service smile on his face.

Suddenly, a thought dawns upon me. What do we look like to the people around us?

If a man and a woman with such a clear age gap are eating together, is it reasonable to assume they're parent and child?

While I think, she's wiping her mouth with a napkin.

And when she looks back up, our eyes meet.
Rin
Yes?
Arishima
Uh, err...
Arishima
It's nothing.

We leave the quaint cafe behind after drinking our coffee.

I ended up paying the whole bill.

Rin seemed confused by it.

But I couldn't possibly let her pay.

The moment we were presented with the bill, she panicked a little. It reminded me how innocent she can be sometimes.

She'll be graduating college soon enough.

And then she'll go out into the working world.

I imagine she'll be asked out to lunch by countless men.

I'm sure by that time she'll have learned how to gracefully deal with a bill like a "proper" lady.

She'll develop that detachment to let a man pay the bill without feeling guilty, since that's what's expected of both parties.

It strikes me that the Rin I'm seeing today is a very fleeting thing.
Rin
Um, thank you for paying.
Arishima
Don't worry about it. Any half decent chap would shoulder the bill.
Rin
But I was the one who invited you.
Arishima
I'm just grateful for the sentiment.
Arishima
I had a really good time. You better invite me out again.
Rin
Really? Can I?

I nod.

Finally, a smile adorns her face again.

We both walk together at a much slower pace than when we were on our way to the restaurant.

The night sky is cloudy, with not a star in sight.
Rin
...Professor?

I turn and look down at her.
Rin
Um... Am I maybe being a burden?
Arishima
What?
Rin
I mean, you have so much going on, and I wasn't aware of any of it.

She's stares down at her feet as she walks. She looks really crestfallen.
Rin
If being in that room is hard for you, you don't need to force yourself.
Rin
I realize that I may have been too open about myself...

I can't help but chuckle.
Arishima
But it's not a burden, and neither are you. Actually...

I trail off and think for a moment.
Arishima
That place is pretty comfortable. It's almost hard to believe.

We walk for a while in silence after that.
Rin
Comfortable?

When I turn to her, I see she's looking up at me.
Arishima
Reading his diary... I somehow felt like he was writing directly to me. To the way I'm feeling right now.
Rin
...
Arishima
He wrote nothing about you or your mom. I got the impression it was an extremely personal diary, just so you know.
Rin
Yes.
Arishima
But... Hmm, yeah. I'm not gonna come here and tell you that there was nothing wrong with the man.
Arishima
But I think he may be the one who understands me the best right now, funnily enough.
Arishima
I feel that same anxiety and frustration like a haze in my head too... It felt like he was putting to paper exactly the way I feel.
Arishima
So it's not a burden, really. I'm actually thankful to you for letting me be there.
Rin
I see.
Rin
That's... good.

Her voice lowers to almost a whisper.
Arishima
I'll walk you home.
Rin
Okay.

We walk through the night together.

I take frequent glances at the sky, but the clouds never clear up.

I can see the yellowy glow of the moon around the edges of a particularly thick cloud.

When we arrive at her apartment building, I look back at her.
Arishima
So, uh, see you in class tomorrow.
Rin
Yes.
Arishima
I had a good time.
Rin
Me too.
Arishima
Well, goodnight.
Rin
Professor?
Arishima
Hm?

She slowly looks up at me.
Rin
What you're reading...
Rin
...was written by someone who lost sight of all paths other than taking his own life.
Arishima
...

There's a distance between us.

Rin sets her gaze in that space.

I'm looking straight at her.

But she keeps her head down, not meeting my eyes.
Rin
Please, don't ever forget that.
Arishima
...

The street lights are distant.

The moon is obscured.

And yet, I can somehow see her face perfectly. Her features are as clear as day.

It's like she's glowing with a light of her own amid a sea of dark.
Rin
You're not reading it because you're headed toward death like he was.
Rin
You're facing death to come back to reality. Even if you need to crawl your way back on your hands and knees.
Arishima
...

Now she's meeting my gaze straight on.

I feel like I'm getting lost in the brilliance of those rose-colored eyes.
Rin
Good night. See you tomorrow.
Arishima
Yeah.

She turns around and walks into the building without looking back.

I stare after her for a while.

I think upon her words as I make my way home.

The memoirs of a person who lost sight of all paths but death...

Those words resound in my mind.

But...

In the end, isn't death the final destination for any human who ever lives?

Old and tired themes race around inside my head.

How should we live? How should we die?

It's true that Shuho chose death in the end.

He actively rushed towards it.

But was it really because he lost sight of the alternative?

No one can know.

Before I know it, I'm back home.

In the mailbox, I find a letter from a law firm.

I heave a sigh.

A conversation with a dead and lifeless Shuho.

A meal with the young Rin.

Each seem like a contract between life and death.

Both encounters had the same timeless, almost magical feel. As if destiny was speaking right into my ear.

It's almost like I'm living another life.

But as soon as I step into the house, I'm suddenly pulled back into that pool of misery I've been swimming in for years.

I wearily open the envelope.

It contains a list of things to settle for the divorce.

First and foremost is what to do with the house.

Will one of us end up owning it, or will it be sold and the money distributed among us.

...It's all bullshit.

I don't feel anything for this house.

I'll give it to her if that's what she wants.

Then she can bring that lover of hers over and they can have their fun without worrying about what anyone might say.

I'll lose what I've deposited, but that doesn't mean I'll be hurting for money.

I don't really care if I'm living alone.

The letter states that my replies must be in writing, via email or letter.

Another sigh escapes my mouth.

I want to get this over with as soon as possible.

At the very least, I have the right to do whatever I want with my time.

If I leave it all to the lawyers...

I'll sign whatever they need, so long as they leave me be.

I decide to answer that way.

The lawyer can take care of this absolute pain of a situation. I just don't want to have anything to do with it.

Putting the stuff from the law firm aside, I check the other envelopes.

There are some for my wife, but most of it is just junk mail.

I gather them all together and throw them into the garbage.

There is one question that hasn't left my head today.

What am I living for anymore?

What am I trying to protect?

I actually felt alive when I was with Rin, but all it takes is stepping into this place for my spirit to slowly degrade back to its miserable state.

I keep repeating the same question to myself, knowing I have no answer.

So far I've just gone with the flow...

But I can't think of any other reason than apathy.

Nothing would be different in the world if I wasn't in it.

Forget the world; even here in this classroom, nothing would change.

All I do is regurgitate grammar rules like a machine.

I'm merely a spectator as my body teaches out of muscle memory.

And I'm fed up.

I don't want to keep spouting words that won't reach a soul.

As Shuho said...

I've lost something that cannot be recovered.

By simply scraping by for so many years...

I'm losing whatever it was that I should have expressed in writing all these years.

I am well aware of this.

Shuho is the one who showed me.

I can't go back to it.

Those days when I could simply continue to exist as an incompetent teacher reciting the same lines year after year...

I don't want to go back to that.

That soulless version of myself...

I don't want to let Rin see me like that ever again.

I can't even look Rin's way anymore.

After work's done, I go straight back to the studio.

Going home or to the library is no longer an option.

I'm desperate to get back to the studio as soon as possible.

"I'm on my way," I write.

I press the send button.

When I arrive in front of the building, I take out my phone again.

My message has been read, but Rin hasn't responded.

I wait there for a while, staring at the screen.

"I'm here, can I go in?"

She reads the message, and her reply comes a moment later.

"Sorry for the late reply. Go ahead," she responds.

After reading her answer, I step inside.

I sit at Shuho's desk and continue where I left off yesterday.

I'm sure Shuho would understand the turmoil I'm feeling.

Yeah, just like I thought.

He was thinking the same things.

The words I'm looking for are right here.

"Only I'm aware of this emptiness that every day brings."

"No one around me realizes."

"The way they all ignore the context is almost frightening."

"If there's anything I've learned from selling books, it's that."

"The world is full of more blind people than I ever thought."
Arishima
Hahahah.

It's thrilling.

This is what he was thinking about?

"Writing books that anyone can understand is a good way to make dumb money. They fly off the shelves; I would know."

"And then there's the blind fools who fashion themselves as critics and lambaste your work with the smuggest of grins and not an ounce of self-awareness."

"The kind of amateur that thinks the length of their criticisms are directly proportional to the quality of their arguments."

"All they know how to do is leech off the work of other people and reap the benefits like a swarm of parasites."

"It's so appallingly shameless that I'm almost impressed."

"Why don't they realize people don't have time for their long-winded drivel?"

"How is it possible to write such garbage and sleep well at night?".

"Why, they never even dare to spout their garbage to my face."
Arishima
They annoy me to no end. They're the scum of the earth.

I keep turning the pages.

His raw thoughts and complaints continue.

"Stop it. You think I don't torture myself enough for my writing?"

"None of you will ever know the despair of printing three million copies of garbage prose."

"I'm as mad at the people around me who would greenlight such trash as I am at myself for writing it."

"That's why I keep rewriting it."
Arishima
Oh?

So that's the real reason behind the revisions that earned him the moniker of "vintner."

I keep turning the pages.

This exceeds whatever excitement I might have felt reading any of his novels.

"I'll never forget the panic on their faces."

"The moment I did all those revisions and prohibited them from putting the old versions on the shelves."

"One after the other, they came to try and persuade me."

"All of them blue in the face from repeating themselves."

"For a while after that, all the publishers were scared."
Arishima
He's like a stubborn kid.

The corners of my mouth twitch into a smile.

I can't bring myself to hate on that earnest impulsiveness.

"But after a while, they got used to even that."

"This is it. I see it now."

"Human beings are made to conform to being unhappy."

"At some point, I became hopelessly numb to my own lack of happiness".

"What's at the end of that road for us?"

"The more we live, the more we become one with misery?"

"The longer we remain in this mortal coil, the more misery seeps into our souls."

"Isn't that a more absolute suffering than even death?"

"Knowing all living things are headed this way, is there any meaning?"

"Is there a meaning to life itself?"

"Is there anything that matters?"

"I know the answer."

"No, there's not."
Arishima
...

The writing doesn't hide his altered state of mind.

He wrote that last part many times, but each iteration looks more erratic and error-filled.

This is all of him.

Shuho...

This is what he should have shown to the public.

He should have abandoned his pride and laid down all that weakness and anger for everyone to see.

Maybe if he'd admitted to himself the damage being inflicted upon him by the thoughtless criticism of those who didn't even understand his struggle.

Maybe he wouldn't have lied his way to the grave.

If the world had known this Shuho, maybe they wouldn't have driven him off that cliff.
Arishima
...

The next page was written on the following day.

"I changed the bindings of all my works."

"But there was one I had to keep the same."

"My debut work."
Arishima
Sakuragicho?

"I used to go to Yokohama a lot back in my college days."

"When you leave Takadanobaba in the afternoon, the sun is beginning to set by the time you reach Route 1."

"By the time you make it to Sakuragicho it's already night, so it feels like you stepped into a whole other country."

"When I gazed out at the cityscape by night, feeling tired from the travel and excited to be there, I truly felt like I wanted to be someone."

"To be famous enough that I couldn't walk around the city, not even with all the money in the world. That's the place where I decided I'd get everything anyone ever wants."

"I had no doubt in my mind that I had the talent and capabilities to make it happen."

"But I was wrong. How wrong I was."

"I wasn't shallow enough to just enjoy the throne once I sat upon it... Not by a long shot."

"I was wrong about everything."

"That was not what I truly wanted. I wasn't in another country, I just crossed into another prefecture."

"That's where all my mistakes began."

"I've always harbored the thought that maybe I could go back there and start over."

"That place, that view... For me, it's like a monument."
Arishima
A monument? A monument to his regret?

I find myself smiling.

It's just a coincidence, but it goes to show how small the world is.

The Sakuragicho observatory.

I've got memories from that place as well.

Back when Shouko and I were still dating, that was the first place we visited together as a couple. Before that we had only met for lunch.

That very same Sakuragicho.

Now, I could say that place is a monument to my regret as well.

We might have more in common than I ever thought.

I turn the next page and see his writing has turned manic again.

It seems like he had days where he enjoyed creating trouble for those around him just for the heck of it.

In that sense...

Shuho wasn't ignorant of social norms; he just enjoyed breaking the mold, to what I'm sure was the dismay of his publishing company.

He never hesitated to do what he wanted.

It almost seems like he feared being thought of as ordinary.
Arishima
...

As I lose myself in reading and forget the time, my phone vibrates.

It's a message from Rin.

"Sorry for messaging so much," she says.

"Perhaps we could meet today?"

Maybe she's still worried about me.

"I'd love to," I respond.

I press the send button.

She reads it right away.

This time she answers immediately.

"If it's okay, I'd like to cook today."
Arishima
She wants to cook?

In her apartment?

I wonder how to respond.

"I'll be waiting in the same spot as yesterday."

"I'll be there in 15 minutes."
Arishima
...

I think back on yesterday.

Her saying she'll be there in fifteen minutes probably means she's already there.

"Got it," I respond.

I send the message then stand up.

Just as I predicted, she's already by the entrance not even ten minutes later.

When I walk up to her, she greets me with a slight bow.
Rin
Hello.
Arishima
Hey.

As usual, she's holding her bag with both hands.
Arishima
So we're going grocery shopping now?
Rin
No, I bought all the ingredients yesterday.

I look down at her as we walk side by side.
Arishima
Yesterday?

She nods.
Arishima
You went out again?
Rin
I ordered it all using the online supermarket app.
Arishima
Huh...
Rin
It's convenient. They deliver everything to your door.
Arishima
I would have gone to the store with you if you told me.
Rin
Then you would have paid like yesterday, right?

She says before glancing up at me and giggling.

I just sigh and shake my head.
Arishima
Let me settle the bill later.
Arishima
I can't just let you pay. I'm the one with a job.
Rin
I thought you didn't care much for being a people person, or following social norms.

Rin's tone is playful and cheery.

I heave a sigh.
Arishima
Okay, I'll let you treat me today. But next time you're gonna tell me in advance.
Arishima
I'm not broke or anything.
Rin
Okay.
Rin
Next time, I'll let you treat me instead.

It's my second time at Rin's place.

It's as neat and tidy as I remember it.

Though there doesn't seem to be much in this house to make a mess out of in the first place.
Rin
Wait just a moment. It won't take long.
Arishima
Sure, thanks.

Rin goes to the kitchen.

I can see her at the kitchen counter from my spot in the living room.

She's washing her hands.
Arishima
Did your dad have a room in this house?
Rin
Kind of. He rarely ever used it.
Rin
He pretty much lived in his studio.
Arishima
I see.
Rin
There's my room, his old room, and a room for the books.
Arishima
So three rooms besides the living room.

Pretty spacious place.

I'd wager there's not a lot of people Rin's age living in a place like this on their own.
Rin
It won't be long, okay? You can go look for a book if you want to read.
Arishima
Nah, I'm fine. I can help you cook if you want.
Rin
It's okay. It's nothing complicated.

She takes out meat and vegetables from the fridge.
Rin
Just sit back and relax. Would you like something to drink? I bought some drinks, just in case.
Arishima
Don't worry. I'll just wait.

And so, I sit down at the table and wait.

I notice a book sitting on the table, on the side where Rin usually sits.
Arishima
You were reading Akutagawa?

She half turns my way and glances at the table.
Rin
After reading the author you recommended, I was in the mood for reading older stuff.
Arishima
Oh, that's good.

I pick up the book and flip through the pages.
Arishima
Did you know that Akutagawa Ryunosuke went to Shiga Naoya for guidance?

She turns to me and gives me a thoughtful look.
Rin
Really?

Keeping my eyes on the book, I nod.
Arishima
The story goes that Akutagawa felt he hit a wall when he turned thirty after becoming famous in this twenties. He also got sick around that time.
Arishima
The two of them were ten years apart, actually. And there was a period where Shiga stopped writing novels.
Arishima
The so-called god of the novel had a period of three years where he didn't write a thing. The story says that Akutagawa went to him around that time.
Arishima
Both of them were authors who showed their true value in short projects rather than long, winding ones.

Rin interjects with nods as I talk.
Arishima
And when the two of them met, Akutagawa told Shiga that he didn't see himself as a novelist, and that he couldn't write.
Rin
He did that?
Arishima
Perhaps he was able to be that honest because he felt they were in the same situation. Kindred spirits and all that.
Arishima
Funny, isn't it? I mean, if Akutagawa can't write, then who in the world can?
Rin
Yeah.
Arishima
But it goes to show just how serious the roadblock was in his mind.

...And Akutagawa Ryunosuke also killed himself in the end.

I flip through the pages.

I find a bookmark on the last page of "Rashomon."
Arishima
You read Rashomon?
Rin
Yes. Many times, in fact. Somehow I keep coming back to it.
Arishima
I know the feeling.

I go to the first page of the short story.
Arishima
"He had little choice of means, whether fair or foul, because of his helpless circumstances."
Arishima
...You could say this was the plea of Akutagawa himself.
Rin
Professor, why do you teach classical literature?

I raise my eyes from the pages and look back at her in the kitchen.
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
You prefer modern literature, as far as I can tell.

I feel a bitter smile spreading on my face.
Arishima
Doing what you love for a living isn't always the best choice.
Arishima
Many writers have shown us that.
Arishima
...Including your dad.
Rin
...

Rin gives a slight nod and carries on preparing the meal.

I continue reading Rashomon with the clinking of utensils against pots in the background.
Rin
I hope it's to your liking.
Arishima
...

She lays the table with large, black porcelain plates.

The comparatively small portions of food in each of them add to the luxurious air of the whole arrangement.

This must have cost her an arm and a leg.
Rin
It's a duck and watercress stew. And...

And in front of me, she places a huge wine glass.

It's the kind of glass designed to let you enjoy the bouquet of the expensive red wine while you drink it.

Definitely not the kind of thing you expect a student living alone to own.
Arishima
How did you buy all this?
Rin
Huh?

I place a finger on the rim of the wine glass.
Arishima
You can't just buy this on your own, right?
Rin
Really? I don't really drink.
Arishima
They make you verify your age. I know you're 20, but they still tend to at least ask when it's younger people.
Rin
I didn't know. I just bought it with my father's personal business card.
Arishima
What? Like a company credit card?

She answers with a reticent nod.

She looks like a little girl who can't comprehend the reason behind an adult's anger.
Rin
Um, you talked about going out drinking with a coworker yesterday, so...
Rin
I thought that maybe you'd like this.

I let out one tired sigh.

So that's it.

This is where the difference in upbringing comes in.
Rin
Are you angry at me?
Arishima
No.

I shake my head firmly.
Arishima
I have no intention of preaching to you.

This is HER apartment, I remind myself.

It's strange for me to even be here in the first place.
Arishima
It's just that...

I look over the fancy dishes lined up on the table.

In a sense, these gorgeously decorated and succulent looking dishes say a lot about what her normal standard is.
Arishima
I think spending money like this to treat people isn't gonna do you much good in the long run.
Rin
I see.
Arishima
It's been 20 years since I started earning my own money, and I don't think I've bought anything as expensive as this wine for myself.
Arishima
Have you ever earned your own money?

With her gaze fixed on the table, she shakes her head.
Arishima
Then you're not treating me here. Rather, I feel like Hatano Shuho's the one inviting me for dinner.
Arishima
That's probably not what you want, is it?

She looks up at me, then down again, and nods.
Arishima
I know you made this with the best intentions, so I'm sorry for making you feel bad over trying to do something nice.
Arishima
...Also, let me pay for the costs. I wanna pay.
Rin
...I'm so sorry.
Arishima
Come on, look at me.
Arishima
I really appreciate the sentiment.
Arishima
It just doesn't have to be this fancy. Remember today and one day, when you're making your own money, you can try treating me again.
Arishima
Hell, it doesn't even have to be me. I'm sure you'll truly understand how nice it feels to treat someone with the fruits of your efforts by then.

She nods in silence.
Arishima
How about we set the wine aside for tonight?
Rin
...Okay.

Everything tastes great.

The professional look of the food actually matches the quality, as far as I can tell.

Then again, it's my first time eating duck and watercress hot pot, so maybe I'm not such a good judge.

But I can say the flavor is miles more sophisticated than whatever I had with Watanabe in that cramped bar.

I wonder about the recipe...

And I feel a pang of pain in my heart imagining Rin carefully choosing this dish from her repertoire and painstakingly selecting each ingredient just for me.

Maybe I should have swallowed my pride and accepted her good will without complaint.

I glance at her and see her still looking down, looking heartbroken as she slowly carries the food to her mouth with the chopsticks. I'm such a piece of trash.

If I were a better man, I could have gotten my message across without hurting her like this.

We go on eating, an awkward silence hanging heavy between us.
Arishima
Thank you. That was delicious.
Rin
Really?

I nod.
Arishima
It was so good I almost couldn't believe it, really.
Rin
...
Arishima
Let me help you wash the dishes.
Rin
No, please. If I let you do that after all this, I think I'll feel so upset I'll cry.
Arishima
I really didn't mean to...
Rin
But you're right. I wouldn't be able to live in a house like this on my own merits.
Rin
I wouldn't even be able to go to the same academy. I couldn't afford the private tuition.
Arishima
You don't need to blame yourself like that. I'd say you have a very rough time without any of your parents around.
Rin
I told you that I feel like there isn't really a place for me here, but now I realize that I still can't do anything without relying on it.
Rin
It makes me feel so sad.
Arishima
All of your classmates are pampered by their parents, even if they don't realize it. Even I was that way. It's not bad to be supported by your parents.
Arishima
It's something we all go through. You had to grow up fast because of your circumstances, but it's not fair to be so harsh on yourself. Don't worry so much.
Rin
I feel like you see me as a kid.
Arishima
Me?

She upturns her eyes at me and nods.
Arishima
Hahah...

When I'm unable to hold back the laughter, she glances up at me, an indignant look tensing her muscles.
Rin
Why are you laughing?!
Arishima
Oh, sorry. It's just that, well, considering how far apart we are in age, I thought that was a given.
Arishima
Besides, we're teacher and student too.
Rin
That doesn't matter.
Rin
If we're just supposed to be teacher and student, then it's strange for you to be here, don't you think?
Arishima
...

I think I dug my own grave here, big time.

She's absolutely right.

It's awfully funny for Rin to be the one lecturing me in this situation.
Arishima
Hah, guess I'm a joke of a social outcast. It's just as you say, I suppose. We're all mad here.
Arishima
No need to take it that seriously.
Rin
No! That's not what I'm trying to say.
Rin
But, I...

Rin wavers for a second then swallows her words.

I stand up and take my bag.

She watches me anxiously.
Arishima
Let me pay before I forget. And let's try to not dwell on what happened tonight, okay?
Arishima
I'll pay for the ingredients and that's that. We'll leave this behind us.
Arishima
If you think you learned something from today and it helps you improve, nothing would make this old outcast happier.
Rin
Yes.

Rin shows me the details of the purchase on the screen of her phone.

I mentally gulp upon seeing it.

Back when I was a student, I could have gotten by for a whole month with this kind of money.

And probably more than half of the total went on the wine alone.

It leaves my wallet in a precarious state, but I manage to pay up.

It's not even an amount of money I'd normally carry with me.

In a sense, I guess I was lucky. It would have been really lame to not be able to pay after all that.

I hand the money over as casually as possible so she doesn't realize how I'm kicking myself on the inside.
Rin
I'm really sorry for having you pay like this.
Arishima
It's okay. We're all square now.
Arishima
I'm repeating myself, but I am gainfully employed, you know. Spending this amount isn't gonna affect me. Don't overthink it.
Rin
...Thanks for the meal.
Arishima
No, I wanna thank you. It was really delicious.

I put my much lighter wallet back in my bag.
Rin
Can I serve you some tea? Would you drink it?
Rin
Though I didn't buy this with my own money either...

I nod.
Arishima
I'll have some, thanks.

After taking my time to enjoy the tea, I get ready to go home.

Rin never seemed to regain her pep in the end.
Rin
I'm really...
Arishima
No more apologies, okay? You didn't do anything wrong.
Arishima
Actually, I'm sorry for souring the mood. I hope you can forgive me.

She shakes her head.
Arishima
...Good night.
Rin
Yes. See you tomorrow.
Arishima
Tomorrow?
Rin
At the academy.
Arishima
Oh, yeah.

I answer with a nod.

Yeah.

I'll see her again tomorrow.

In that classroom.
Arishima
See you tomorrow.
Rin
*Sigh*

That was so pathetic, I almost broke into tears on the spot.

It was so embarrassing.

I didn't even know what to say.

I couldn't reply to anything.

It was so frustrating.

I'm so mortified and embarrassed.

The last thing I wanted to show him was a childish blunder like that.

I go back to the living room and sit at the table.

I'm sure the first thing he felt when he stepped into this house was Hatano Shuho's shadow.

And maybe that's something he didn't want to see.

It was so insensitive of me.

And I was acting so confident...

Talking like I know everything...

But he still managed to uncover all of that and put the kiddie hat firmly back on my head.

I feel so restless.

I can't figure out what my heart is telling me.

I've never felt this way before.

Oh, I see.

This is the first time anyone has ever gotten angry at me.
Rin
...

If I had a father and a mother...

Do people living under the same roof get mad at each other like this? And they keep on living together?

Maybe I'm the one that's not normal?

I don't know.

I can't figure it out, and I doubt I'll learn much from reading Hatano Shuho's books.

In front of me, resting on the table...

There's the collection of stories by Akutagawa Ryunosuke.

I open the little paperback.

I go to the opening page of Rashomon. Rereading it has become somewhat of an habit of mine.

"Because of his helpless circumstances..."
Rin
'Little choice of means, whether fair or foul,' huh?

After that dinner with Rin, I find it hard to take my mind off her.

I keep wondering whether I took the right attitude today.

She looked so down the whole night.

This is the second time she's gotten emotional in front of me.

The first time was when we went into Shuho's studio.

She cried that day.

She asked me to save her, choking back tears as her voice lowered to a murmur.

The memory is still fresh in my mind.

Today...

The situation was completely different. It wasn't that serious to begin with.

Children who feel rejected by their parents but are still unable to live without their support are often overcome by feelings of powerlessness.

It's a tale as old as time.

But is it really of the same magnitude as the absolute shock and devastation she must have felt finding her father dead in a bathtub?

Despite everything, she took what happened today in stride. In her own way.

It just seems like the fact that the evening went so differently to how she envisioned it made her really embarrassed and upset.

Her sadness that day was caused by Shuho, and in a sense, I'm the one who caused it today.

That thought...

Makes me strangely happy.

My words are touching her heart.

That fact makes me happy.

Back home, I find another letter from my wife's lawyer waiting for me.

It's about some documents that need my signature.

Some kind of declaration of consent.

Something about me accepting the conditions they declare.

I'm completely sick of it.

My time with Rin...

And my time in Shuho's studio...

Both seem to rejuvenate my heart.

I feel closer to death than ever with Shuho, and I have never felt more alive than when I'm with Rin.

The sharp contrast between them only highlights them more starkly within my mind.

I feel like I'm somehow being honed by the two of them, making me sharper, more sensitive to what I'm feeling and my surroundings.

And this house just tries to dull that edge.

Everything in this house clings to me, slows me down to a crawl.

It's so awful I can barely stand it.

But...

But I'm sure that when morning comes, I'll buckle down and sign this paper.

Then I'll carefully put it in the return envelope and send it away.

Then I'll change into a fresh set of clothes and go to work.

In a shirt I washed and ironed myself.

Although no one is forcing me to do it, I'll change into the clothes that make me that gainfully employed adult I told Rin about and go to work.

I won't feel alive like I do when I talk with Rin in her apartment.

I'll just spend another day in vain.

That's what I'm going to work for.

But then, why am I even doing it? What am I trying to protect?

I have no compromises to anyone but myself, so why am I going back to that miserable and colorless existence?

I'm teaching Rin's class today.

When I'm here, my words can't reach her.

No, that's not quite right.

The words coming out of my mouth in this classroom aren't my own.

Even if they literally come out of me, they won't ever reach her, not really.

And I realize that I'm starting to hate it.

I really don't want Rin to see this side of me.

That whole thing about changing myself, that I would even be able to...

I'm beginning to think it's possible, or at least I want it to be.
Watanabe
Phew, the week's finally over.

It's lunch break.

As usual, I'm smoking with Watanabe.

I shift my eyes from the slowly rising smoke and turn to him.
Arishima
No lectures this afternoon?
Watanabe
Nah. We've covered everything that'll be on the exams, now it's up to them to revise it.
Arishima
I see.
Watanabe
It's almost time, eh?
Arishima
Huh?
Watanabe
For summer break.
Arishima
Oh, yeah.

The end-of-term ceremony is almost upon us.
Watanabe
You going anywhere?
Arishima
Nah. Don't really have any plans.
Watanabe
What? It's a month and a half! You're just gonna laze around?
Watanabe
Oh, I get it. Guess you'll be fine as long as you can spend the day in a bookstore, right?
Arishima
...

I guess that was the case until last year.

I did seem to spend most of my summer break in libraries.

I didn't have any work to do, and my wife wasn't home most of the time.

I just read books at my own leisure, and before I even knew it, the second semester would have already started.

But I wonder about this year.

I'm planning to keep reading what Shuho left behind, but maybe Rin will be away for a while.

I remember that she came to the wake for her dad's teacher.

It's possible she has other family events to attend.

If we get the chance to talk again, I'll ask about her plans for this summer.
Watanabe
I'll get you a souvenir.
Arishima
What?
Watanabe
I'm telling you I'm going on a trip. To Yakushima.
Arishima
Oh? Who with?
Watanabe
Were you not listening to anything I said just now?
Arishima
...

I exhale some smoke and nod.
Watanabe
Why do you even bother lying?!

When I leave work for the day, I get in contact with Rin.

I see the conversation from yesterday on the upper part of the screen.

I think about the dinner she prepared so carefully for me, and I ruined.

For there to be a next time, I'll probably have to be the one inviting her out.

But maybe it's too soon after yesterday?

While I'm thinking, a reply from her comes in.

It's just the usual "okay."

I keep floundering on whether to ask about her plans for tonight, and even write a draft, but I end up not sending anything.

I step into the room again and take a deep breath.

The oppressive, stagnant air fills my lungs.

This place makes me feel at ease.

When I'm here, I'm free from the shackles of the world outside.

I don't have appearances to keep up. I don't have to pretend like I care about my work.

I remember my dinner with Rin.

Now that I think about it, neither she nor her mother appear anywhere in these diaries.

I've read months' worth of entries at this point.

And not a single page mentions Rin, even in passing.

I feel my eyes getting tired and look away from the pages.

I take my phone out of my pocket.

it's around 8 p.m.

The last two days, Rin invited me out around this hour.
Arishima
...

I wonder if I've fractured our relationship with my criticism yesterday.

I stare at the static screen for a while, then stow it back into my pocket and continue reading the diaries.

But soon my eyes are glazing over and nothing sticks with me.

I keep pulling out my phone and opening up my chat with Rin.

She hasn't sent anything.

"I'll go home for today."

I send her a message as I lock the door on my way out.

She replies straight away.

"Good job."

That's all.

The silence at home is becoming more and more agonizing.

I stare down at the lunch box I got from the convenience store.

It feels so strange.

This is how I've had dinner for most of my marriage.

Alone in the living room, eating with a spoon in one hand and a book in the other.

The day my wife left this house was the first day I shared a meal with Rin.

It's only happened twice.

We've only eaten together those two times.

Yet losing that is making me feel so, well, lost.

It's making me feel more lonely than my wife's departure did.

I've been alone for the last 20 years, yet it's like I'm only starting to feel it now.

I keep wondering how Rin's day is going.

Do her thoughts keep turning to yesterday like mine do?
Arishima
...

I start hating myself, as usual.

These worries I'm having are more like what someone Rin's age might have.

I look around the living room.

Digging in my heels and trying to argue would be a pain.

Besides, I can't deny that I'm in the wrong.

This place will probably not be my home for much longer.

I no longer have any appearances to keep up.

If I prefer spending time with Rin to eating alone, all I have to do is invite her out.

So what if I'm the teacher and she the student?

That's just one aspect of the positions we happen to be in right now. A label that doesn't have anything to do with us as individuals.

I'm sure Rin must be thinking the same way. She wanted to spend time with me, after all.

It's Friday.

Tomorrow, I can spend the whole day at Shuho's studio.

And then I'll invite Rin out to dinner.

As soon as I leave home, I drop her a message letting her know I'm heading to the studio.

But I receive no response from her.

When I reach the apartment complex, I slow down my pace.

I decide not to go in until she gives me permission.

I feel like it's important to keep at least that boundary.

I check my phone.

She hasn't even read the message yet.

I lean on a wall by the entrance and wait for a while.

"I'm here."

Twenty minutes have passed since I sent that last message.

She still hasn't read it.

Residents of the building come and go in front of me.

I'm going to draw attention to myself if I keep hanging around here.

It's not like I'm doing anything wrong, but I decide to go somewhere else while I await her response.

After a short walk, I find a diner.

There are a few families waiting to be seated by the entrance, but I get to go in first since there's a table for two free.

I get myself some coffee from the free refill machine and take a look around the place before sitting down.

It's all families enjoying the weekend as far as the eye can see.

I wonder what it means to be a dad.

The thought just pops into my head.

I feel like all the men sitting here with their families must have the answer to that question.

They all look younger than me.

About the same age as Watanabe, I'd say.

But they undoubtedly have that air of fatherhood about them.

I wonder at what point a father gets that fatherly look.

It's not like men go through the physical ordeal that women undergo to give birth.

If you spend every day with your child, does that naturally make you a father, in time?

I look at the families enjoying themselves and realize that I'll probably never have a weekend like this in my life, considering my future prospects.

I turn my attention to my phone and press the power button to light up the screen.

There are no new messages.

She hasn't even read them.

This is the first time I've gone so long without an answer from her.

What is Rin doing right now?

The smoke from the mini grill billows up into my face.

Is it ready?

I cut the sausage in half and spear each piece with a toothpick, just like they showed me.

I carefully serve them up on one of the small plastic plates I was told to use.

I raise my face from the plate and look ahead.

I'm behind a food counter in the supermarket.

Everyone's walking by slowly, looking at the food on offer.

I take a deep breath.
Rin
Welcome...
Rin
Would you like a sample?

My timid words disappear into the bustle of the store.
Rin
Welcome...

No one stops to look.

I feel so hopeless.

The sausages I cooked are going cold.
Byte reader
You need to be louder.

I look back and see the nice man who showed me the ropes of the job this morning.

I got so spooked I almost missed what he said entirely.
Rin
I'm sorry...
Byte reader
You'll get used to it. Everyone's shy at first.
Byte reader
You don't remember the clerks when you're the customer, do you? Don't worry, no one's judging you here. They just come to buy food.
Rin
...

After saying that, the man walks onto the sales floor shouting "welcome" really loudly.

He's shouting, but no one reacts to him.

I see. Right now I'm just part of the furniture.

My voice is like the background music of the supermarket.

I take another deep breath.
Rin
Welcome! This is a special sampling campaign! Feel free to help yourself!
Rin
Welcome! They're fresh and hot! Come and get yours!
Tasting madam
Oh, can I try some?

I don't even see the old lady who's walked up in front of me until she's already there.

I find it curious that she asks if she can have some when she's already grabbed a sausage.
Rin
Yes! Go ahead!
Tasting madam
Thank you, sweetie. Don't mind if I do.

She pops a sausage in her mouth, throws the plastic plate in the trash, and leaves.
Rin
Welcome! We're holding a sampling campaign! Feel free to try some!

When I raise my voice...
Rin
Ah, go ahead!

A balding old man approaches and takes a sample.

He's wearing a jacket with an unusual amount of pockets.

I wonder if he uses all of those.

While I wonder about his jacket, he takes a sausage and eats it.
Bald old guy
This is pretty good.
Rin
Thank you!

I made a sale!

The man who just sampled the sausages purchased some.

I'm actually doing my job now.

I watch him walk away, then keep going renewed resolve.
Rin
Welcome!

I open the next bag of sausages while I shout, cut them up, and begin cooking them up on the mini grill.

By the time the sun sets, I still haven't received a reply from Rin.

I finished reading the book I thankfully thought to bring with me.

It's a little past 6 p.m.

I put down my collection of Akutagawa's short stories and take a look around the diner again.

The customers are different, but what hasn't changed is the happy and cheerful bustle of families having a good time together. I feel completely removed from it all.

If I lose Shuho's studio...

Will the rest of the world become this unfamiliar and uncomfortable for me?

How on earth did I manage to live until today?

How did I keep myself sane?

Perhaps just having a family, even if was the faint illusion of one...

Perhaps that's what kept me stable all these years.

But all of that is gone now.

Without contact with Rin and access to that room, it's like I'm not connected to anything in the whole world.

I let out a small, inaudible sigh as I leave my seat.

Even when the sun goes down, it's still hot and humid outside.

Feeling a little silly for not having dinner while I was at the diner, I sigh. As I walk, I feel my phone vibrate in my pocket.

I stop, take it out, and stare at the screen.

It's a message from Rin.

"Are you free tonight?"
Arishima
...

I simply stare at the message for a moment.

My heart starts beating a little faster.

It's kind of sad and funny that such a simple message can make me react like this.

I feel so pathetic for clinging to Rin like this.

But the excitement is so great I can't contain it.

"I do, let's have dinner together," I write.

And I press the send button.

The message is marked as read as soon as I send it.

It takes another moment for her to respond.

"I'll be waiting at the usual spot."

And below her message, there's an image of a little bird dressed up as a Daruma doll.

A Java sparrow?

Did Rin send this?

Does it mean she's in a good mood?

I stow the phone back in my pocket and rush to the usual spot.

I go at a light jog, and find her standing like always, holding a shopping bag with both hands.

She's holding a supermarket bag instead of her usual bag.

When she sees me, she looks surprised.
Rin
Huh? You weren't in the studio?
Arishima
Ah, err, that was the plan.

She tilts her head to the side in confusion.
Arishima
I wanted to wait until you gave me the okay to go in.

Her eyes open wide as the realization dawns upon her.
Rin
But I gave you the key! You could have just gone in anyway!
Arishima
I figure it's really your studio now, so I wouldn't want to trespass.
Rin
So you stayed outside all day?

I nod.
Rin
I see. I'm so sorry. I thought you were in there already.
Arishima
It's fine. It wasn't a bad weekend.
Rin
You're too uptight sometimes.

She lets out one of those cute giggles.
Rin
Where did you go?
Arishima
Some diner around here.

I glance down at the bag she's carrying.
Arishima
And you? Went shopping?

She gives me a small nod.

Then she flashes me a meaningful smile.
Rin
Professor, can I cook for you again today?
Arishima
Huh?

She looks up at me, the smile on her face only growing bigger.
Rin
It won't be anything as fancy as yesterday, though.
Rin
I'd love to try again, if that's okay.
Arishima
...

I take another look at the bag she's holding.

It's a plastic bag with the logo of a major retailer, and it's full of what I assume is ingredients.
Arishima
You want to cook again?

She gives one firm nod and lifts the bag a little.
Rin
I bought it all with my own money. I want to treat you properly.
Arishima
Your money?

She nods enthusiastically.
Rin
That's fine, right?
Arishima
...

I'm sitting at Rin's table again.

She's in the kitchen, sorting the ingredients as she takes them out of the bag.
Arishima
By your own money, you mean...

She turns my way and gives me a bright smile.
Rin
I've been working part-time.
Arishima
Part-time?

I repeat her words back like a parrot.
Rin
There aren't many jobs where you can just show up whenever you like and get paid immediately.
Arishima
Why so sudden?

She raises her face and turns her eyes to me.
Rin
Didn't you tell me to?!
Arishima
Yeah, but I wasn't expecting you do it the next day!
Rin
Is it that strange?
Arishima
Nah, just surprising. A welcome surprise.
Rin
I'm glad.
Rin
I feel like it was worth it just to see the surprise on your face.

Rin teases me as she takes out carrots, onions, and potatoes.
Arishima
What kind of job?
Rin
Hawking food samples.
Arishima
You? Really?

She frowns at me.
Rin
What about it?
Arishima
Nothing, it's just that...

Her, yelling at people to try food samples?

It's a little hard to imagine.
Arishima
It's just kind of hard to imagine you working in a supermarket.
Arishima
You know, since it's such a bustling place and all. That's not really your scene, is it?
Rin
I decided to try working there exactly because of that! Didn't you say assuming things about people is bad?

She sounds displeased.

I'm so thoroughly schooled that I can't help but laugh.
Arishima
Yeah, you're right, prejudice is bad. There's nothing wrong with that kind of work. What were you giving out samples of?
Rin
Sausages.

She takes a package of sausages from the bag and holds it up for me to see.
Arishima
You bought those?

She nods.
Rin
Guess I fell for my own sales pitch.
Arishima
Did you have fun?

She gives a vague nod.
Rin
It was really stressful at first, but I did enjoy it a bit by the end.
Rin
They got mad at me for a lot of little things.
Rin
And I was told I was too quiet so many times.

I can't help but chuckle.
Rin
But I think I understand what you were trying to say now.
Arishima
How so?
Rin
Shopping with money you earned yourself really is more fun.
Rin
I couldn't buy much, though.
Arishima
Are you sure you wanna spend your first paycheck on making food for me?
Rin
Of course. I earned it because I wanted to give you a treat.

She beams at me.
Arishima
I'm honored.
Rin
That wine was really expensive, wasn't it? I'm sorry for making you pay for it.
Rin
Earning money is so hard...
Arishima
Hahah...

As I laugh out loud, Rin blushes fiercely.
Rin
Hey, what's with you today?! Are you making fun of me?!
Arishima
No way. I would never.
Rin
...

She glares at me like a cat about to pounce.
Arishima
You're just too sweet.

That does nothing to loosen her sulky expression.
Arishima
I'm really happy that you took my words to heart and are trying to improve yourself.
Arishima
It makes me feel like I still have some kind of bond connecting me with something.

Her expression changes to one of surprise as she stares at me.
Arishima
I'll accept your kindness today.
Arishima
Thank you, really.

After staring at me for a moment, a smile slowly crosses her face.

Looks like that did the trick.
Rin
Yes.

I watch her at work in the kitchen for a while.

As I do, I feel my nervous heart slowly regain its normal beat.

She keeps on cooking in silence.

Watching her go to and fro makes a kind of affection that I've never felt before swell in my heart.
Arishima
Want me to take a guess?
Rin
Huh?
Arishima
About what you're cooking.

She looks at me, clearly surprised.
Arishima
Curry.

Her eyes widen for a moment.

And then she laughs.
Rin
Well guessed!
Arishima
I figured.
Rin
You said you're always up for curry, right? Plus it's easy to make, and the ingredients are cheap.
Arishima
Don't think I'll ever have enough of curry. It's good because you can eat it with one hand. I always read a book with the other.
Arishima
Jinbocho style.
Rin
That's news to me.

Rin giggles as she stirs the big pot.
Arishima
I can help if you want. I really don't mind.
Rin
Even elementary students can manage curry. Just sit back and relax.
Arishima
Gotcha.

She giggles, and I get comfortable in my seat.
Rin
I hope you like it.

She presents me with a plate of curry with rice, and a huge bowl of salad.

She also sets down a plate with a bunch of fried sausages in the middle of the table.
Arishima
It looks delicious.

For some reason, she laughs.
Rin
Is that supposed to be praise?
Arishima
I'm pretty sure it was.
Rin
Well, it's hard to mess up curry, isn't it?
Arishima
You'd be surprised. I've had my share of bad curry over the years.
Arishima
It's quite possible to make bad curry, as unlikely as it sounds.
Rin
So?
Arishima
Yours looks really delicious.
Arishima
Perhaps the best looking curry I've ever seen.
Rin
Ahahah!

She laughs out loud.
Rin
You just weren't thinking too hard about what you said, huh?

She quirks an amused little smile.
Arishima
...

Helpless, I simply nod.
Rin
Thank you very much.
Arishima
Uh...
Rin
Let's eat.
Rin
I hope it's at least more delicious than that bad curry you mentioned just now.
Arishima
We'll see about that.
Rin
Yes.

I take a spoonful and bring it to my mouth.
Arishima
Mmh...
Rin
How is it?
Arishima
It's really damn good.
Rin
I just used normal cheap curry powder, though.
Arishima
No, it's really good. I'm not lying.

I really am not.... this time.
Arishima
It's way better than the stew from last time.

With her eyes still on me, she blushes a little.
Rin
I'm glad.
Arishima
I've been eating out for years. It's been so long since I tasted real home cooking.
Rin
Years?
Arishima
It warms my cockles, I mean it. It's really good.
Rin
I'm happy to hear that.

I take another bite and don't stop.

She slowly eats away at her plate too.

I glance at the sausages lined up in the middle of the table.
Arishima
And the sausages are a nice bonus.
Rin
Yeah. I feel like I've cooked enough sausages for a lifetime.
Arishima
I sure wasn't expecting them along with curry.
Rin
I haven't eaten a single one yet! I kinda wanted to try them after cooking so many.
Arishima
Makes sense.

I stab one with my fork and take it to my mouth.

She does the same and slowly savors it.
Arishima
So, how is it?
Rin
Surprisingly...
Arishima
...
Rin
...plain.
Arishima
Pfft...
Rin
Heheh.

We both laugh together for a while.

After we're finished, I wash the dishes.
Arishima
You made me dinner with your first ever paycheck. Let me do this much.
Rin
Oh, you really don't need to...

Rin watches distractedly as I wash the dishes.

As I finish, I notice a package of instant coffee on the kitchen table.
Arishima
Oh, coffee. Mind if I make some?
Rin
Yes, go ahead. I bought it for you, actually.
Arishima
Really?

She nods.
Rin
Thank you.

I see the mug I used last time and Rin's mug on the draining board.

I line up the cups and set the drip bags in them.

After adding a little bit of cold water to cool it, I pour the hot water between them.
Rin
Why do you add cold water?
Arishima
I read that if the water's too hot, it ruins the scent.
Rin
Whoa, really?
Arishima
I don't really mind when I'm making it just for myself, though.

I tell her with a sad smile.
Arishima
Well, anyway, I hope you enjoy my special instant coffee. I'm very particular about it.

She giggles at that.
Rin
I'll keep that in mind.

We sit facing each other at the table again.
Rin
You... came to read my father's diary today, right?

I nod.
Arishima
That was the plan.
Rin
...Is it really that interesting?
Rin
I mean, you've been reading it every day.
Arishima
It's strange. We've never met, but he feels really familiar somehow.
Arishima
If I'd known we were so alike, I would have dropped my stupid stubbornness and talked to him when we were in college.
Rin
Stubbornness? You were like that?
Arishima
Back then I wanted to get my debut novel published too. Shuho's the one who made that dream come true right in front of me.
Arishima
...I didn't want to be one more in the crowd just looking up at him.
Arishima
I was probably thinking that I was the only one among us who was seriously thinking of getting my stuff published and making a debut.

Suddenly, that little self-deprecating demon speaks into my ear.
Arishima
I suppose I was thinking that I should at least win some rookie award before talking to him. So we could be on equal footing and all that.
Rin
So that's why you didn't know him very well in college. I thought it strange, since you attended the same seminar.

I nod.
Arishima
That was more than twenty years ago.
Arishima
And in the end... I never managed to stand on equal terms with him.
Arishima
Actually, I don't think anyone can ever stand on his level anymore.
Arishima
I was only able to face him after his death. I'm just sympathizing with the statue of the man that was.
Arishima
And I think it could have only happened on these terms.
Arishima
Ironic, isn't it?
Rin
I...

I raise my head as she murmurs.
Rin
...don't think my father ever stood so high up.
Rin
His works did sell really well. That's why I'm living in such an expensive place.
Rin
And today I understood how grateful I should be for that.

Rin squints through the smoke rising from her mug.
Rin
But all I ever learned from him...
Rin
Was that he regretted me ever being born. Nothing besides that.
Rin
I don't think someone like that should be on the lofty pedestal you're placing him on.

I stay silent for a while.
Arishima
Being a successful and acclaimed writer...
Arishima
...has little to do with how virtuous one is as a person.

She turns her eyes up to me and nods.
Arishima
I know where you're coming from, but Hatano Shuho was...
Rin
Professor.

After gently cutting me off, she shakes her head.
Rin
You can't understand how I feel.
Arishima
...
Rin
I'm sorry. I was the one who took you there.
Rin
But I never imagined you would develop this admiration for him.
Rin
...
Arishima
You want me to say he was an overrated writer? That in the end, he was just a bad person?
Rin
...
Arishima
I'm not blaming you for rightfully feeling the way you do. Don't get me wrong.
Arishima
I just don't think repeating the same criticisms and blanket writing him out as a completely horrible person will help you move on either.
Arishima
I don't think that will help you at all.

She's still staring down at the mug in front of her.

I heave a tired sigh.

Today, she went to work with the express intent of earning money to treat me to dinner with.

Why does it always end on a sour note because of my big mouth?
Arishima
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spoil the nice evening. I just really think you need to overcome that.

She raises her face and looks at me.
Arishima
Even if he was a failure as a parent, and even if he was a guy who got a woman he didn't love pregnant.
Arishima
Even if his works don't speak to you on any level.
Arishima
The fact that his writing has saved many people is still true.
Arishima
And I believe the things he achieved as a writer are things only a great person in that field could do.
Arishima
You need to separate the image of Shuho that he left you with from the image of the author that people who didn't know him have.
Arishima
If you can't reconcile that, you'll keep on feeling angry and sad.
Rin
I know that! I'm well aware of it!
Rin
I know, but...

Rin trails off at the end, but I know what she meant to say.

"You don't understand."

"I know what I've lived. It's my truth."
Arishima
You can do it.

She looks up at me again.
Arishima
You still have time. It'll be fine.
Rin
...
Arishima
You took my preachy talk from yesterday on board and showed me just how much you grew in a matter of days.
Arishima
You're sweet, honest, and young.
Arishima
I'm sure you'll grow into a wonderful woman.
Arishima
So it's fine. I know you can overcome this.

Still looking at me, she giggles.

Unsure what to make of it, I only stare.
Rin
You know so much, but you don't understand a woman's heart.
Arishima
Uhh...
Rin
I think I'm very stubborn myself.
Arishima
...

Suddenly, she exudes a lot more confidence. She doesn't look like a girl being reprimanded anymore, but a woman.
Rin
That's why I invited you today.
Arishima
...
Rin
Do you know what I'm trying to say?
Arishima
...

I think upon her words for a long moment.
Rin
I don't want you to treat me like a little girl.
Rin
And I don't want to play second fiddle to anyone else in your heart.

She has a confident, bewitching smile on her face.

My eyes are drawn to it like moths to a flame.
Rin
I can't bear you seeing everything I do under the shadow of my father.
Rin
That's why I made you dinner today with my own hard earned money. It has nothing to do with that man.
Rin
I just couldn't accept you seeing me as a helpless, dependent girl. That's pretty stubborn, isn't it?

It's not a rhetorical question.

Her sharp, almost icy stare seems to pierce through me.
Arishima
...I see.

She tilts her head to the side, waiting for me to keep going.
Arishima
Okay. I'll remember that. I won't treat you like a kid anymore.
Arishima
You're not my student when we're here. I'll try to put that out of my mind.

Pleased, Rin's smile slowly widens.
Arishima
Thank you for the dinner. It was delicious.
Rin
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Arishima
So, next week.

She raises her eyebrows and looks at me curiously.
Arishima
Can I spend the night there?
Rin
There? You mean at the studio?

I nod.
Arishima
It's almost summer break, so...

I stop myself.

What am I gonna do during the break?

Edit the manuscript I wrote?

Write something new altogether?
Rin
I don't really mind.

Her eyes wander for a moment, but then they settle on me.
Rin
Just please, don't use the bathroom.
Rin
Don't even go in there.
Rin
It's like stepping into death itself. At least that's how I felt.
Arishima
...
Rin
If you can promise me that, then you can stay.
Arishima
Okay.

I give her a firm nod.
Arishima
I promise.
Rin
All right.
Arishima
Thanks.

After putting on my shoes, I turn to her.
Arishima
Well, I guess this is it.
Rin
Can I...
Arishima
Hm?
Rin
Can I cook dinner for you again?

I look down at her, at a loss for words.
Rin
...

She looks down, obviously bashful. I respond with a firm nod.
Arishima
I'd love that.

She looks up again, beaming at me.
Arishima
But next time let's go shopping together. I'll pay.
Rin
Yes. Then let's go tomorrow. Together.

I nod again.
Rin
Have a good night.
Arishima
Yeah, you too.

I remember the first time we spoke...

Back then, I thought that I shouldn't get closer than necessary to one of my students.

But now she's been making dinner for me in her own apartment.

Perhaps I changed without even realizing it myself.

Yes. I must have changed.

Just like the fathers I saw today at the diner turned into family men at some point.

I'm changing so gradually that I'm not even aware of it.

I started writing a novel again, divorced my wife, and I'm reading the diaries of a dead man.

It's such a huge change.

And it all began with my encounter with Rin.

That rainy day we shared an umbrella under the cold downpour.
Arishima
...

It was the day of the funeral for the old seminar professor.

Death was present on the day we met, too.

We met in the wake of a death, and came together again over the death of another person; Hatano Shuho.

If this was a novel...

Naturally, the final destination of the character would be death.

That way, the story would feature death in all three acts.

I laugh to myself.

I see now.

If I were headed towards death...

Then my life would almost be...

...like a story.
