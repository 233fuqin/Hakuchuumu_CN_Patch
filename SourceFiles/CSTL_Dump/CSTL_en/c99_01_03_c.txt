With that, Izumo gets up.

I follow her lead.

Yonagi watches us then does the same.
Kaito
...You coming?
Yonagi
...

She nods and leaves her seat.
Izumo
We have basically all the equipment you'll need for your daily lives. There are bathroom facilities and a simple recreation area as well.
Kaito
I see. So that's what we get in exchange for not being able to go outside?

Izumo walks at a brisk, soundless pace while the little robot floats after her.

I walk behind them, with Yonagi trailing behind me.

I can hear her bare feet slapping against the floor.
Kaito
Can't we even see the outside?
Izumo
There is a rooftop.
Kaito
I'd like to see that.
Izumo
Understood.

The elevator door opens in front of us.

A cool air blows onto our faces as it does.

When I move to step outside...
Yonagi
...

Yonagi stops me, pulling on my sleeve.
Kaito
You don't wanna go?

She shakes her head.
Yonagi
*Cough*

She lets out a small cough.

Right, the air outside is pretty dusty.

That's how it's always been in Underground Shinjuku.

The air is cleaner indoors.
Izumo
Do you want to wait inside?

Yonagi languidly turns to Izumo and bobs her head.
Izumo
Wooleep, stay with her.
Shleep
*Happy chirping*
Kaito
...

Izumo and I go out onto the rooftop while Yonagi and Wooleep stay behind.

Yonagi stares at me until the elevator doors close.
Izumo
Yonagi doesn't seem to like this place particularly.
Kaito
Seems not.
Kaito
Is it... okay to leave her alone?
Izumo
Hm? She's with Wooleep.
Kaito
Huh? Ah, yeah, right.
Izumo
Everything inside the facility is being constantly monitored. There is no need to worry.
Kaito
...So she doesn't need Wooleep, does she?
Izumo
Just in case.
Kaito
In case of what?

Izumo simply nods and starts walking.

I follow after her.

It's a little cold outside.

I walk towards the railing and look up at the sky.

A wave of relief hits me.

This is the sky I know.

The round sky, surrounded by high walls.

The outside world is just as I... remember.

Looking down, I see a large domed plaza in front of me.

It's surrounded by high walls of gray concrete.

And above that, the sky is blue and the sun dazzling.

This is the world I know.

Without my memories, I can't really judge how much of my perception is correct.

But this is the Japan I know. I know in my heart that this is Shinjuku.

I wonder if anyone has found a way to really stand under that sky.

It doesn't look like much has changed from the mental image I seem to have, so the answer is probably no.

Taking a deep breath, I notice tiny dust particles mixed into the air.

The air indoors is a lot cleaner than outside.

That too...

...is the world I know.
