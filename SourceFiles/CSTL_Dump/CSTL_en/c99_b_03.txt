After eating the porridge made for us by Izumo, Yonagi and I head to the recreation room.

Yonagi drags a chair into the middle of the room.
Yonagi
Sit.
Kaito
Hm?
Yonagi
This is Yonagi's beauty salon.
Kaito
Oh, I'm the client?

Yonagi nods.
Kaito
All right, thanks.

I sit down on the chair, and Yonagi wraps a colorful cloth around my neck.
Yonagi
How do you want your hair?
Kaito
I wanna feel fresh.
Yonagi
Oookay.
Yonagi
Chop chop chop.
Yonagi
There, I cut it a little. Do you feel refreshed?
Kaito
I sure do.
Yonagi
I'll do your makeup now.
Kaito
Huh? Really?
Yonagi
You're a pretty girl right now.
Kaito
Oh, okay.
Yonagi
And I'll make you even prettier.
Kaito
Th-Thanks.
Yonagi
I'll put the eyeliner on you now. Close your eyes, please.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
Now I'll put on the lipstick.
Kaito
Okay.
Yonagi
Ah, don't open your mouth.
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Understood?
Kaito
...Yeah.
Yonagi
I told you not to open your mouth, remember?
Kaito
...
Yonagi
Understood?!

Please, have mercy.
