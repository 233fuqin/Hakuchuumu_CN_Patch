Once we arrive at the recreation room, Yonagi walks up to the bookshelf, takes out a picture book, and goes to sit down on the floor.
Kaito
A picture book?

Yonagi nods.
Kaito
Let's see...

The title on the cover is "Yamanashi."
Kaito
Looks pretty old.

I read the author's name.
Kaito
Miyazawa Kenji... Born in 1896.
Kaito
Almost three centuries ago.

That is, if my memory-less perception is right.
Kaito
It's amazing how this has stood the test of time.
Yonagi
Wanna read?
Kaito
Err, uh...
Yonagi
Read.
Kaito
Me?

She nods.

I sit next to her and look at the pages.
Kaito
...
Kaito
Here are two blue magic lantern slides, projecting the bottom of a small mountain stream.
Kaito
Two tiny young crabs are playing at the bottom of the blue brook.
Yonagi
What is a crab?
Kaito
Well...
Kaito
They're animals that live in the water. I haven't actually seen any, though.
Yonagi
Animals.
Kaito
Yeah, these ones. See? These two little animals.

I say, pointing at the bright little creatures depicted in the book.
Kaito
Clammbon laughed.
Kaito
Clammbon's laughter went pop, pop.
Kaito
Clammbon jumped and laughed.

Yonagi pulls on my sleeve.
Yonagi
What's Clammbon?
Kaito
Hmm...

Good question.

I've never seen a crab in my life.

And as far as I can tell from the picture...
Kaito
Maybe it's this bubbly thing?
Yonagi
Bubbly...
Kaito
...Foam?
Yonagi
Foam.
Kaito
Yeah.
Yonagi
Clammbon is foam.
Kaito
Maybe.

What if I'm wrong?

It's not like I have anything else to go on, though.
Kaito
Can I keep reading?
Yonagi
Mhm.
Kaito
Clammbon's laughter went pop, pop.
Kaito
The ceiling and the sides are like dark blue, impenetrable steel walls. Dark bubbles flow along the smooth, running ceiling.
Kaito
And this is the end of the magic lantern slide.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
...The end.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Did you like it?

Yonagi nods.
Yonagi
I feel sorry for the fish.
Kaito
Yeah, poor thing.
Yonagi
Now this.
Kaito
Yeah, up next is... The Little Mermaid.

More water stuff?

And it's a tragic story too.
Yonagi
Read it, read it!
Kaito
Okay, you're the boss.
Yonagi
...
Kaito
Huh? Yonagi?

After reading four books to her, she begins to rub at her eyes.
