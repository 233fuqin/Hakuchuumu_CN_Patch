Monday is the day where I have the most classes to teach.

Rin is in my sixth period lecture today.

The last of the day, as it happens.

After finishing work, I'll head to the library.

I keep writing on the blackboard at a steady pace.

I continue giving my predetermined lecture.

My thoughts come to a standstill as I keep going right up until the bell chimes.

It's a part of the life I've been living for years.

As usual, I finish up the lecture, stop by the staff room, and go to the library.

I sit at a table by the window.

I gaze absently outside.

Just then, I spot Rin walking towards the library.

She looks up at me and smiles.
Rin
Did you finish it?

I give her a weak nod.

She cocks her head slightly to the side.
Arishima
If I give you this, it might be just an annoyance for you.
Rin
Why?
Arishima
...

I spend a moment thinking of what to say.
Arishima
...I just wonder if I'm in way over my head here. Doing something I shouldn't.
Rin
...
Arishima
My wife said something to me.
Arishima
She said that, if there was anything worthwhile in writing what I want to write, I wouldn't be here working as a professor.
Rin
Your wife? The editor?
Arishima
Yeah.
Arishima
When she said that, I lost my motivation. I got scared.
Arishima
Scared of having someone else read my writing.

Rin simply stares at me in silence
Arishima
...But I'm glad I wrote this. I mean that.
Arishima
I...
Arishima
I started writing again because you said you wanted to read my writing.
Arishima
Everything you've said to me since the day we first met has helped me face Shuho.
Rin
The things I said?

I take the manuscript out of my bag and present it to Rin.

She stares at it, clearly surprised.
Arishima
I wanted to see if I could help you, even a little. Since you said you wanted to know your dad.
Rin
You wrote this for me?
Arishima
...

I don't know how to answer.

It's true that's part of it.

I do want to help her somehow.

But wouldn't telling her that be too... compromising?

While thoughts race through my mind, she quietly reaches for the manuscript, and our hands touch.

Our fingers overlap atop the papers.
Rin
I'm really, really happy.
Rin
It means a lot that you wrote this for me.

Still smiling sweetly, she lets go of my hand.

I can still feel her faint warmth on my skin.
Rin
Can I read it?
Arishima
If you want to.
Rin
I want to.

I nod.
Arishima
...Thanks.
Rin
Will you wait while I read it?
Arishima
Huh?
Rin
I'm not such a fast reader, though.

I nod.

Rin takes the manuscript and flips through the pages.

After watching her for a while, I turn my gaze out the window.

I attempt to read some books, but I'm unable to concentrate and end up simply waiting without doing much.

Rin's eyes meticulously glide over the letters.

By the time the sun starts setting, she's reached the last page.
Rin
...

She finishes reading and raises her face.
Rin
Now I understand how you feel about my father.

I nod.
Rin
What did you want to achieve in this piece?

I simply stare at her in silence.

She looks down at the manuscript again.
Rin
The person you described here is someone else, not my father.
Arishima
...
Rin
So what do you really want to achieve here?
Rin
Do you really want to depict my father?

Unsure how to answer, I simply stare at her.

She slowly shakes her head.
Rin
I'm asking because I believe you can write.
Rin
You're a very fragile person. More so than you think.
Rin
You can still turn back.
Rin
But you've already started writing.

She lays a hand against my cheek.

I'm left stunned and speechless.
Rin
You need to choose.

As she speaks, she stares directly into my eyes.
Rin
If you want to write a real novel and depict a real person...
Rin
If you are prepared to depict real humans...

She trails off, then writes something on a piece of paper.
Rin
Come here after classes are done tomorrow.
Rin
...I'll be waiting.

With that, Rin stands up and walks away without looking back.

She left the manuscript on the table.

I...

I'm overcome by an indescribable sense of helplessness and defeat.

I've never felt this way before.

I don't really remember what happened between the library and getting home.

The next thing I know, I'm staring at the ceiling of the living room in darkness.

If you are prepared  to depict a human...

Her words keep echoing in my head.

What did she mean?

She might as well have said that what I wrote wasn't a depiction of a real person.

It would have been easier to swallow if she just said it was boring.

I close my eyes.

I feel a combination of defeat and regret.

The emotions seep into my chest and coat my very core.

I brush my fingers over my cheek.

Rin's hand touched my cheek today.

She laid her hand on top of mine.

I feel a phantom heat in the places where she touched me.

That was before Rin read my novel.

She must have been looking forward to reading it, only to be met with disappointment. Tends to happen when it comes to me.

My work, my effort...

That messy manuscript left on the desk of the library is all the proof I need

She deemed it unnecessary. She discarded it like trash.

Yet I cannot keep my mind from the faint warmth of her hand.

I was ridiculed.

I wish that heat would burn everything down so I can stop thinking.

Me and my writing. Put down like garbage in a can.

Just then, I hear a noise at the front door.

I hear the sound of shoes coming off by the entrance, followed by approaching footsteps.
Shouko
Why are the lights off? What are you doing?

My wife puts her bag on the table by the sofa and walks to the sink.

She's inadvertedly put her bag on top of my scattered manuscript.

Out of the bag sticks a creased, brown envelope.

I extend my arm and take it.

I don't recognize the author of the work inside of it.

I stare at the words absent-mindedly.

Until I hear fast approaching footsteps, and Shouko swipes the manuscript out of my hands.

I slowly turn my face to look up at her.

She looks down at me, her expression one of subdued fright.
Arishima
Is that from the writer who was here the other day?

She merely frowns, offering no answer.

A trickle of wry laughter escapes my lips.
Arishima
Have you been been drinking?

I look up at her, a corner of my mouth curling into a smirk.

She keeps staring at me, dumbfounded.

I notice the slight flush in her cheeks.

She's never been able to hold her drink very well.

I see the distrust in her eyes as her expression darkens.

How dare she look down on me like this?
Arishima
I'm your husband, aren't I? What're you giving me that look for?
Shouko
What?

As she takes a step back, I get up and approach her.

She lets out a small breath, and with it comes the distinct smell of alcohol.
Arishima
Why do I have to put up with everything, huh?!

Something in my head snaps, and I seize my wife by her shoulders.
Arishima
Why do I have to put up with all this shit?! Why am I wasting my life here when no one even wants me?!
Shouko
Wha... Stop it! Get off!
Arishima
You're my fucking wife!

Not heeding her cries, I pull her towards me.

A strange scent hits my nose as soon as she's closer.

It's not the smell of her perfume.

It's the scent of another man.

I laugh cruelly.

She holds her breath, looking up at me with terror lacing her pupils.

What the hell am I doing?

What even is my life anymore?
Arishima
Tell me! What did I do to deserve this?!
Shouko
G-Get off me! Stop!

Paying no mind to my wife's protests, I push her down onto the sofa.
Shouko
Hey! Knock it off! It hurts! Ugh!

I lean over her back and pin her down.
Shouko
N-No! D-Don't!
Shouko
What are you even doing?! What's wrong with you?!

All I see in my head is Rin.

I feel the burning desire to touch her.

I want to make that delicate body mine.

I want to... become one with her.

A sense of disgust and inferiority sticks to me like ink.
Arishima
I...

Driven by that sick desire, I strip her clothes off.
Arishima
I have no other way...

For the first time in decades, my wife's body seems alluring to me.

She's kept herself in good condition... to roll around in bed with some young writer.

Though I do have memories of us doing it for the sole purpose of making a kid once upon a time.

In this very house.

But this is different.

Time has changed it all.

Her protests peter out in time, turning into recalcitrant hatred.

This is very much like a microcosm of our marriage.

Such are the thoughts racing in my head as I desperately force myself upon her in an attempt to drown out Rin.
Shouko
...

She quickly regains her breath, gets up, and directs a glare at me.
Shouko
You bastard...

She spits out a last insult before swiftly picking up her underwear and going to the restroom.

She slams the living room door behind her.

I stare at the scattered papers still laying on the table.
Arishima
...I wanted you to read it too.

Without even thinking, I mutter at nothing.

The words trickle off my lips, destined to never reach anyone's ears.

I was young.

And so was she.

Back then, we took our lives for granted.

When did it become so difficult and painful?

We used to say what we meant.

We were vulnerable in front of each other.

Once upon a time, we were a real couple.

With a heavy sigh, I sink into the couch.

I turn my face up to the ceiling and cover my eyes with my right hand.

Tears slowly make their way down my face, rolling down my cheeks one after the other.

I've fallen the lowest a person can go.

I fall back on the sofa, nothing but a dirty, shameful mess.

I'm so pathetic and disgusting that I make myself laugh.

I wanted to be someone.

Like Hatano Shuho was.

Someone who would have recognition.

I didn't want to become this pathetic mess.

At some point, I break into weak sobbing.

I weep like a damn child.

What's worse, Rin's image is still burned in my mind.

Perhaps for good, I realize.

...I should have never written a single word, let alone a novel.

From the bottom of my heart, I wish I hadn't.
