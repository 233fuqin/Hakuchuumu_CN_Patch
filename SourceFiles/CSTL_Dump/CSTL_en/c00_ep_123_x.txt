Kaito
So they're all happy now, huh?
Yonagi
Yeah, they sure are.
Kaito
Are you happy too?
Yonagi
Mm?

I turn to face her.
Kaito
Huh?
Yonagi
I suppose it all depends on you now.
Kaito
Uh, okay?

Yonagi looks up at me, her cheeks flushed.
Yonagi
I want to be your girl, always. We've always been family, but I'm also your wife. I don't want to ever forget that.
Yonagi
Do you think...
Yonagi
...you can make such a demanding goddess happy?

Her blush deepens as she looks up at me.

I wrap my arms around her shoulders and hold her closer.
Kaito
Of course. That's my duty too.
Yonagi
I have high hopes for you.

For a while, we simply watch the sun dip below the horizon in silence.

The sea breeze grows colder and colder.
Kaito
It's getting chilly. Shall we head back?
Yonagi
Mhm, good idea.
Kaito
Izumo should be on her way back from her shopping trip too.
Yonagi
I-Izumo went shopping?

Yonagi's eyes become round as saucers.
Kaito
When you hear what's on the menu for dinner, it's gonna blow your socks right off.
Yonagi
Uh, porridge, right? Or not?

I simply laugh.
Kaito
Let's join her. I'll send her our location data.
Yonagi
Izumo!

As soon as we rejoin the mountain trail from the beach, we find Izumo waiting for us.

Yonagi waves and calls her name as we approach.
Izumo
Welcome home.
Yonagi
It's nice to be back! You look so good!

Izumo merely nods.
Kaito
Izumo, we're all going to be living together from now on. Can you take care of dinner?
Izumo
Understood. I'll buy enough for three.
Yonagi
You're eating with us?!

Izumo nods.
Kaito
What do we have on the menu for today?

Izumo eyes the bag dangling from her arm.
Izumo
I purchased some flounder, so I plan to make carpaccio for the appetizer.

Yonagi gasps, her nostrils flaring from the shock.
Yonagi
Carpaccio?!
Izumo
Also caprese salad.

Now Yonagi's eyes look like they're about to pop right out of their sockets.
Yonagi
Caprese?!
Izumo
The main dish is polpette in tomato sauce.
Yonagi
The heck is that?!
Kaito
Izumo's been really into Italian food lately.

Izumo bobs her head.
Kaito
Polpette is the Italian term for meatballs. It was in an encyclopedia I read as a kid, actually. Line 583 in the section on Western cuisine.
Yonagi
Can you stop it with the memory flexing?! No way I can remember any of that!
Izumo
...

Izumo twitches for some reason.

Perhaps she's reacting to how similar Yonagi's mannerisms were to Azuki's just now.

We all head home together.

Izumo walks a few paces ahead.

Yonagi and I link arms and enjoy the cool sea breeze as we follow her.
Yonagi
I can't wait to try Izumo's cooking.
Izumo
I will not disappoint.
Yonagi
Ooh!

Izumo states, as a matter of fact.

Yonagi looks back and smiles at her.

The little seaside cabin comes into view.

This is the home we're gonna share from now on.

A place with a beautiful view of the vermilion sunset reflecting off the calm sea.
Yonagi
Kaito?

I turn to Yonagi.
Yonagi
Do you love this world?

I feel the corners of my mouth raise as I give her a resolute nod.
Kaito
Yeah, I love this world. From the bottom of my heart.
