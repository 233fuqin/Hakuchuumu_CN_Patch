Kaito
In the dream, I was in a place called Chiba prefecture?

Izumo nods.
Izumo
Nariyama City.
Kaito
There were a bunch of white birds there. I think someone called them...
Izumo
Pigeons. But they aren't pigeons. They are biological communication devices called artificial pigeons.
Izumo
Their development was announced by Hazuki Izana in 2031. By the year 2035, five hundred million artificial pigeons were released out to the world as the first test of the system.
Izumo
After that, the number of pigeons increased, and a global, cheap, and stable communication network was provided to the whole world.
Kaito
I see.
Izumo
However...
Izumo
On July 10th, 2046, all the artificial pigeons went out of control. Suddenly, they began to emit jamming radio waves all throughout the pigeon network, rendering all electronic communication devices useless.
Izumo
This phenomenon is commonly known as the wave eating.
Kaito
Wave eating, I see.
