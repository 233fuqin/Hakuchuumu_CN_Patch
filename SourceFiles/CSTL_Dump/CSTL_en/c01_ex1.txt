Rin
Kaoru, do you remember this?
Arishima
Mm?

I come out of our baby's room after putting her to bed, and Rin calls out to me from the kitchen.

As I come into the kitchen, I notice she's holding a bottle of red wine.

She raises it to me, lifting an eyebrow and smiling suggestively.

I take a moment to examine the label.

It's not a brand I'm familiar with, which means it's probably expensive. Not that I know much about wine, mind you.
Arishima
...Nice bottle. Where did you get that?
Rin
I bought it. With my own hard-earned money.
Arishima
Mhm, I see.

This brings back memories.

It's been four years since that.

It's the same wine she set on the dining table the first time she cooked for me back when she was still my student.
Rin
Oh goodness, no. I went out of my way to go and buy another bottle of it. It looks like it was from a good year, so the price hiked up compared to last time.
Arishima
It became even more expensive? Well, I'll be...

It was expensive enough four years ago.
Rin
It was summer back then too, remember? In fact, that day was today, four years ago.
Arishima
Whoa, really?
Rin
It's our duck and watercress anniversary.

I can't help but chuckle at the idea of an anniversary for our first dinner.
Rin
That's why I prepared the same thing for this special occasion. I couldn't make the duck dish again, though.
Arishima
The wine is more than enough. Thank you, honey.

I go to the cupboard and pull out two glasses for red wine.

They're mostly decorative, really.

Rin started to drink with me when she became of legal age for it, but we don't drink on a daily basis.

It's not something I'm looking to change. At the most, I have a few beers on the weekend, but only if I feel like it.
Rin
I bought this too, but could you open it? I've never done this before.

Rin presents me with a brand new sommelier knife, and sits down at the table.
Arishima
Okay, watch and learn.

I deftly cut the capsule open with the new knife.

I insert the screw in the center of the cork and turn the now T-shaped knife.

To be honest, I'm not very good at it.

But nonetheless, Rin watches attentively with a sweet smile on her face.

The cork comes out with a satisfying popping sound.

The end of the cork that was in contact with the wine has turned a bright purple color.

She looks up at me, a satisfied smile spreading from ear to ear.

I meet her gaze and proceed to pour some wine into the glass set in front of her.

This thing was thirty thousand yen before prices went up.

I can't help but wonder how much it set her back this time.

And whether or not I'm making some kind of mistake in my handling of this fine wine.

I manage to hide my trepidation for long enough to finish pouring us two glasses of wine.
Rin
Shall we toast?

I nod and sit down opposite to her.

She raises her glass to me.

I reciprocate the gesture by raising my own.
Rin
I read it's not very good manners to touch glasses.
Arishima
That so? Well, let's toast like this, then.
Rin
Yes.

Rin takes a dainty sip from her glass.

I bring my own glass to my lips and feel the thin rim between them.

It feels so delicate, I'm sure it could easily break while washing if handled without care.

I tip the glass back slightly and have a taste of the red wine.
Rin
...

My first impression of the taste is... rather flat and uninspiring.

It goes down my throat without making much of an impression. Guess you could say it's smooth, at least.
Rin
So this is how it tasted, huh?
Arishima
I hear that good wine changes its taste depending on how long it's in contact with the air. Maybe this is one of those?
Rin
Oh, that'd make sense.
Arishima
That's why the glasses are so big and why people in restaurants swirl them around—it's to let the wine breathe.

She stares at me, her eyes wide in admiration.
Arishima
At least that's what I read in one of Hatano's books. Which was it, again? Must have been from some compilation of essays he wrote about his hobbies.
Rin
Ah, I do remember reading that, now that you mention it.

She brings the glass to her smiling lips again.
Rin
Do you remember how you got mad at me that day? It was really mean of you.

I falter for a moment before answering.
Arishima
Yeah, I remember it well.

She flashes me a meaningful smile.

I know that smile.

That's the face she makes when she's toying with me.
Rin
Would you say I started earning my own money like you wanted? I think I've grown a fair bit since then. I mean, we're raising our sweet little girl now.
Arishima
Yeah, you're a grown woman now.
Rin
And I think I'm a lot better at dealing with the public, if I do say so myself.

I answer with a nod.

Rin casts her mischievous gaze down at the purplish wine swirling in her glass.
Rin
I still think about it sometimes. If I had been in your position, what would have I done back then?
Rin
How would I have treated that young girl with no sense of the money she had?
Arishima
...

She looks straight into my eyes with that same sly smile.
Rin
If I was me, I don't think I'd break her heart just for trying to do something nice for me.
Arishima
Mhm...
Rin
I really don't think I'd have the heart to grab her innocent good intentions and crush them beneath my heel. Who would ever do such a thing?

She says, all smiles.

Man, it's been a while.

I remember the day she described herself as a very persistent person.

And I fully agree with that self-assessment.

My young, beautiful wife can be persistent and vindictive beyond comprehension.
Arishima
...You've been holding onto that for four years, have you?
Rin
Oh, no. Holding onto it? I'd never.
Rin
No, why would I?
Arishima
You are right, though. I was young too. In fact, I'd say I'm still green in a lot of respects. I'm learning from you every day.

The smile quickly disappears from her face, replaced with an icy glare directed squarely at me.
Rin
It ticks me off when you just take things in stride like that.
Arishima
Sorry to disappoint.

After treating me to a little more of her disdainful look, the facade finally drops and she smiles again.
Rin
No need to apologize, silly.

AThen she raises the glass to her lips one more time.

I watch as the wine is welcomed between her lean, velvety lips.

Not a bad sight, I must admit.

But a moment later, her eyebrows shoot up and she exclaims.
Rin
I think it got a little sweeter!

I follow her example and take another swig of my glass.

The taste has indeed gained some depth and body.
Arishima
Guess all it needed was some fresh air to reach its peak after being bottled up for so long. Reminds me of you, actually.
Rin
Huh?

I can see that took her by surprise. She eyes me askance before continuing.
Rin
We're drinking such rich wine, but all you can manage is dry remarks, I see.
Rin
I mean it, you say such unpleasant things sometimes. It just reeks of an old vintage, and not a particularly well-aged one. Why, it's starting to make the wine smell corked.
Arishima
...

I turn my quickly blurring gaze up.

The last thing I need is to let her see the tears pooling in my eyes.
Arishima
...Sorry about that. I'm sorry for being so old.
Rin
It's okay, I love that about you.

The tears keep making my vision blur.

It takes all of my focus to not start sobbing on the spot.
Arishima
Thank you...
Rin
My words exactly. Thank you for letting me have my fun and tease you sometimes.
Rin
Now, wipe those tears, silly. We have a bottle to finish, and the night is young.
Arishima
Mhm.

I dab at the corners of my eyes with the tissue she hands me, turn a smile to her, and put the glass to my lips again.

As the wine gains an even richer depth, I can't help but wonder if braving through the tears might have deepened my appreciation for it.

It's very much like my life, I suppose.

Heh.
