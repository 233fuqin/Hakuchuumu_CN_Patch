Kaito
...

So this is my face.

I reach out a hand toward my reflection in the mirror.

I have some serious crow's feet carved into the corners of my eyes and panda-like bags beneath them.

My face looks distressingly gaunt.

I see now that the reason I'm sleepy isn't just because I'm in a comfortable environment.

I've clearly been suffering from a severe lack of sleep.

What in the world have I been doing?

Depending on how you look at it, one could say I'm lucky.

That android, Izumo, seems to at least know me.

Simply having my dreams monitored seems harmless enough for now.

Perhaps a better arrangement than being thrown out onto the streets without any memories.

They even feed me here.

I've gotta consider the possibility that my memories might come back on their own.

I look back and see Yonagi still lying prone.

She's sleeping on her right side, one arm under the pillow.

I sit down on my bed.

Her face is turned this way.

She has her eyes closed.

I also lie down and rest my head on the pillow.

I stare at the ceiling for a while.

I hear the faint whirring of the air conditioning.

And the scent of cedar reaches my nose.

...Yes, cedar.

I'm in a state of near total amnesia.

But I get the feeling that I used to be someone with a good memory.

The soft sheets urge me toward sleep.

And I notice the light in the room gradually dimming.

All at once, I'm in the dark.

I feel my consciousness slipping.

A sweet numbness wraps around my body as the boundaries between wakefulness and sleep melt away.
