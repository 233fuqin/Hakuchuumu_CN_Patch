Sumomo
Oh? You're back early today?
Kanna
Yeah, today's shoot got cancelled.
Sumomo
Huh? But why?
Kanna
Err, some kind of weird epidemic, I think?
Sumomo
You okay?
Kanna
Yeah, the model from yesterday was acting weird all morning.
Sumomo
That sounds bad. Were they okay?
Kanna
Apparently they looked fine, but their speech was kind of strange.
Sumomo
What do you mean?
Kanna
But there's no one who speaks funny like that in our office.
Sumomo
Mm...
Kanna
My maestro had no clue who it could be. I had no idea what was going on either.
 
How so?
Kanna
I mean, there's no one who speaks gracioso around us. No one at all!
Sumomo
Kanna?!
Kanna
Hmm?
Sumomo
You know you're not holding a camera right now, right?
Kanna
Camera? I don't, porque?
Sumomo
You're doing that on purpose! No, this can't be happening! We're not at work!
Kanna
Me? I am being my usual self, like always?
Sumomo
Is this a pandemic? Is the weird talk spreading in the air?
Kanna
Oh well. Anyway, I got a libre day now. How about we go out for a good almuerzo?
Sumomo
I can't do this... I can't go outside with him like this... Okay, I need to call Azuki.
Kanna
Azuki?
Azuki
Hey, hey! What's up, duraznos? Why the sudden llamada? You surprise me!
Sumomo
You're the model that got sick?!
Kanna
Hola, Azuki.
Azuki
Hola, amigo.
Sumomo
Maybe it's about time I joined the ranks of the crazies. Being sane is only bad for my health anyway.
Azuki
Ah, something happen at work, Dulce?
Kanna
Oh? Didn't you come to advertirnos of the weird disease?
Azuki
Nah, that wasn't me? My manager hurried to come and tell me. He told me to take the dia off, and then Duraznos here called me.
Kanna
Ya veo.
Sumomo
The heck's going on here?! You two don't realize?!
Azuki
What do you mean?
Kanna
You are acting rather rara, Sumomo.
Azuki
Fastidiosa too.
Sumomo
What is this? How can I make it end? Yeah, Kanna gets like that when he has a camera, so maybe if I give him a camera to hold...
Kanna
Hmm?
Sumomo
Kanna, can you take a picture of me? It's been a while!
Kanna
Really? Sure.
Sumomo
Come on, take the camera.
Kanna
Mhm.
Sumomo
How do I look?!
Kanna
How? You're adorable, like siempre.
Sumomo
Damn it!
Azuki
Man, you sure life a feliz life, Duraznos!
Sumomo
Oh, could you shut up?!
Kanna
Ahahahah!
Sumomo
You're pissing me off!
Sumomo
What do I do now? They don't sell medicine for this, do they? Do I just wait for it to wear off? No, I don't think my mind can take it...
Kanna
What's wrong, Ciruela?
Sumomo
Ciruela? I'm Sumomo! Me hablas a mi?!
Azuki
Ahahah! Was that spanish? You're talking like Spencer now, Duraznos!
Sumomo
Are you listening to yourself?!
Sumomo
You've been talking like freaks this whole time!
Kanna
Hahahah!
Azuki
Ahahah!
Sumomo
What kind disease is this?! I'm gonna record this nonsense! Give me the camera!
Kanna
The cam, right?
Sumomo
Oh, shut up!
Sumomo
Okay, you two talk again now!
Azuki
Talk? About what?
Kanna
Hmm, I'm not too used to being on the other side of the lens.
Sumomo
...Are you for real right now?
Azuki
Huh?
Kanna
Mm?
Sumomo
It's gone?! So it goes away when you point the camera at them? This Spencer disease is a huge pain, huh?
Azuki
What's gone?
Kanna
What are you talking about?
Sumomo
You two were talking all weird like Spencer just now!
Azuki
Nah, don't talk crazy.
Kanna
Not even I can imitate how he speaks completely. You know it's too embarrassing for me to do outside of work.
Sumomo
Oh wow, you got a sense of propriety?
Azuki
Well, whatever. We haven't had a day off in a while, so why not go out and eat at a nice place?
Kanna
My thoughts exactly.
Sumomo
I'm so tired already. I think I need a drink, actually.
